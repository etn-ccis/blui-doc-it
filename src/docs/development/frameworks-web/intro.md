# PX Blue Web Frameworks
Power Xpert Blue supports web application development using Angular and React. Both are open source JavaScript frameworks with large communities of support and both have open source component libraries implementing Material Design. The two are quite comparable and you would not go wrong by choosing either, but there are some notable differences outlined below.

## Angular (with Angular Material)
  - A comprehensive framework, with a lot of built-in features and functionality
  - Written in TypeScript (superset of JavaScript with strong variable typing)
  - Structured way of organizing your entire application (if following the Angular CLI)
  - May be more accessible to developers with greater back-end or full-stack experience
  - Maintained by Google
  - Learn more on the [Angular website](https://angular.io/)

## React (with Material UI)
  - A UI library for building custom Web Components/Applications
  - Can be combined with additional libraries (e.g. Redux) to be a more comprehensive framework
  - Virtual DOM allows for fewer re-renders (i.e., faster UI updates)
  - May be more accessible to developers with greater experience with JavaScript and front-end development
  - Maintained by Facebook
  - Learn more on the [React website](https://reactjs.org/)


# Which framework should I use?

Choosing a framework is entirely up to you. They each have their own pros and cons, so you'll need to decide what is best for your application. In general, if you have developers who are very familiar with a particular framework, it might be worthwhile to use that framework to avoid any unnecessary learning curves associated with a new one. If you don't have development resources yet, you will probably want to conduct a more in-depth analysis of the available frameworks to decide what is most appropriate for your application. Feel free to reach out to us for assistance if needed.

If you choose to use one of these frameworks, have a look at our Guides for using them with PX Blue:

- [React Guide](/development/frameworks-web/react)
