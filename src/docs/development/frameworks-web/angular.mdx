# Getting Started with Angular

The following instructions will guide you through starting a new Brightlayer UI project using Angular. Alternatively, you can also start your project by downloading one of our code samples from [Github](https://github.com/brightlayer-ui) (the Login or Navigation examples are good projects to start from).

## Using the Brightlayer UI CLI

The fastest way to start a new Brightlayer UI project is to use the [Brightlayer UI CLI](/development/cli). The CLI will automatically create a starter project for you (using the [Angular CLI](http://cli.angular.io/)) with all of the necessary Brightlayer UI dependencies pre-configured. To start an Angular project:

```sh
npx -p @brightlayer-ui/cli blui new angular
```

You will be asked to provide a name for your project and whether or not you want to use the Brightlayer UI eslint and prettier configurations files.

The Brightlayer UI CLI will automatically include:

-   Angular Material Component Library ([@angular/material](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/material))
-   Brightlayer UI Component Library ([@brightlayer-ui/angular-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/angular-components))
-   Brightlayer UI Themes ([@brightlayer-ui/angular-themes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/angular-themes))
-   Brightlayer UI Icons ([@brightlayer-ui/icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/icons))
-   Brightlayer UI Colors ([@brightlayer-ui/colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/colors))
-   Open Sans web font ([@font-source/open-sans](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fontsource/open-sans))
-   Brightlayer UI ESLint and Prettier configurations, if selected ([@brightlayer-ui/eslint-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/eslint-config) / [@brightlayer-ui/prettier-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/prettier-config))

For detailed usage instructions, refer to the [Brightlayer UI CLI documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/cli).

## Using an Existing Project

If you have an existing project and would like to integrate Brightlayer UI, you can follow the manual integration instructions below. If you have not already started your project, we recommend that you scaffold your project with the Brightlayer UI CLI.

# Manual Brightlayer UI Integration

Before taking the following steps, you'll want to make sure that you have an existing application. If you used the Brightlayer UI CLI to start your project, these steps have already been done for you automatically.

## Including the Component Libraries

### Angular Material

Angular projects should make use of the [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) component library. Our Brightlayer UI themes are designed to work with these components.

```sh
npm install --save @angular/material
// or
yarn add @angular/material
```

For detailed documentation about the various components available in Angular Material, as well as sample code and API reference, refer to the [Angular Material Documentation](https://material.angular.io/components/).

### Brightlayer UI Components

Additionally, we have a [supplemental library](/development/components) of components designed specifically for Brightlayer UI applications. If you wish to use these components, you can install them by running:

```sh
npm install --save @brightlayer-ui/angular-components
// or
yarn add @brightlayer-ui/angular-components
```

## Adding Brightlayer UI Themes

By default, your application will be themed with the Google Material theme. To use the [Brightlayer UI theme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/angular-themes), first install it:

```sh
npm install --save @brightlayer-ui/angular-themes
// or
yarn add @brightlayer-ui/angular-themes
```

Installing the theme package will automatically include the Open Sans web font package as well as the Brightlayer UI [colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/colors) package. In order to use the Brightlayer UI themes and font (Open Sans), you will need to modify your angular.json file "styles" entries (there is one under "build" and one under "test") to include the Brightlayer UI themes and Open Sans reference:

```json
"styles": [
    "src/styles.scss",
    "./node_modules/@brightlayer-ui/angular-themes/theme.scss",
    "./node_modules/@brightlayer-ui/angular-themes/open-sans.scss",
],
```

### Applying the Theme

You can apply the theme to your application by adding the proper class to your application's body element:

```html
// Default Theme
<body class="blui-blue" />

// Dark Theme
<body class="blui-blue-dark" />
```

> If you do not specify a theme class, your application will use the default Material theme.

You can access the fonts using mat-typography, e.g.:

```html
<section class="mat-typography>
   <h1>H1 Text</h1>
   <h2>H2 Text</h2>
   <p>Paragraph text</p>
   <div class="body-2">Bold body copy</div>
</section>
```

You can access theme colors as well, e.g.:

```html
<mat-toolbar color="primary">My App</mat-toolbar>
```

More details about applying themes in your application can be found in [Theming your Angular Material app](https://material.angular.io/guide/theming).

# Additional Information

## Code Formatting / Style

Brightlayer UI provides packages for code standards and style using ESLint and Prettier. These packages are used internally by the Brightlayer UI team, but they can also be used in your projects. You can find instructions for adding these packages to your project on [GitHub](https://github.com/etn-ccis/blui-code-standards).

## Browser Support

Brightlayer UI supports the same browsers as Angular and Angular Material. For specifics, please check out their support pages:

-   [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/guide/browser-support)
-   [Angular Material](https://github.com/angular/material2#browser-and-screen-reader-support)

> With the end-of-life of Internet Explorer 11, Brightlayer UI will no longer be supporting IE11 as of 2021.

## License Information

[Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/LICENSE) and [Angular Material](https://github.com/angular/material2/blob/master/LICENSE) are both available under the MIT License.
