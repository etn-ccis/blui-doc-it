# Brightlayer UI Templates

These are project templates that are used for starting a new Brightlayer UI project. The templates are configured with the basic Brightlayer UI libraries for themes and components and configures the application to use them.
These templates are available for React, and React Native. A skeleton project will be created in your chosen framework and automatically integrate:

-   Material and Brightlayer UI component libraries
-   Brightlayer UI themes
-   Open Sans Typography package
-   Brightlayer UI colors package
-   Brightlayer UI code formatting and linting profiles (optional)

When starting a new project, you will have the opportunity to select a template as your starting point, including a blank template, basic routing template, and a full authentication template.

> These templates are available for [React](https://github.com/etn-ccis/blui-react-cli-templates/blob/master/README.md#react-cli-templates), and [React-Native](https://github.com/etn-ccis/blui-react-native-cli-templates/blob/master/README.md#react-native-cli-templates).

To start a new project using the React Template:

```sh
npx create-blui-react-app
```

To create a new project using the React Native Template simply run:

```sh
npx react-native init MyApp --template @brightlayer-ui/react-native-template-blank-typescript
npx react-native init MyApp --template @brightlayer-ui/react-native-template-routing-typescript
npx react-native init MyApp --template @brightlayer-ui/react-native-template-authentication-typescript
```
