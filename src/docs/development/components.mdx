# Brightlayer UI Components

Brightlayer UI offers custom component libraries to simplify building your application by implementing common use cases in Brightlayer UI and eliminating the need for multiple teams to build their own components. These components are supplementary to basic components offered by [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/components/categories), [MUI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/supported-components/) and [React Native Paper](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/).

All Brightlayer UI components are available as NPM packages:

-   [@brightlayer-ui/angular-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/angular-components)
-   [@brightlayer-ui/react-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/react-components)
-   [@brightlayer-ui/react-native-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/react-native-components)
