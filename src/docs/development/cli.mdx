# Brightlayer UI CLI

<EmbeddedYouTubePlayer videoID={`CESJ9BKLWco`} />

The Brightlayer UI CLI (Command-Line Interface) is a tool for quickly starting new projects using Brightlayer UI. It will create a skeleton project in your chosen framework and automatically integrate:

-   Material and Brightlayer UI component libraries
-   Brightlayer UI themes
-   Open Sans Typography package
-   Brightlayer UI colors package
-   Brightlayer UI code formatting and linting profiles (optional)

When starting a new project, you will have the opportunity to select a template as your starting point, including a blank template, basic routing template, and a full authentication template.

> These templates are available for [Angular](https://github.com/brightlayer-ui/angular-cli-templates/blob/master/README.md#angular-cli-templates), [React](https://github.com/brightlayer-ui/react-cli-templates/blob/master/README.md#react-cli-templates), and [React-Native](https://github.com/brightlayer-ui/react-native-cli-templates/blob/master/README.md#react-native-cli-templates).

To start a new project with the CLI:

```sh
npx -p @brightlayer-ui/cli blui new
```

For more detailed information and usage instructions, check out the [@brightlayer-ui/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/cli) package on NPM.

## Supported Frameworks
