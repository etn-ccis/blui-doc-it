# Welcome to Brightlayer UI

<ImageGrid images={[DesignSystemImage]} regularWidth />

Brightlayer UI is a complete design system for web and mobile applications. This system will help your team build beautiful applications that adhere to our design guidelines while ensuring flexibility and code reusability.

> Check out our [Release Notes](/release-notes) to see what's new in the latest version of Brightlayer UI.

## Design

The goal of the Brightlayer UI design system is to ensure consistency between software products delivered by different teams. With a common aesthetic and common guidelines, we can be sure that all products feel like they belong to the same family.

Brightlayer UI is based on the [Material Design](https://material.io/) language. If you are working with our Studio Blue design team, their designs will follow this standard. If you are not utilizing Studio Blue, ensure that your designers are following the Material Guidelines as well as any additional Brightlayer UI [design patterns](/patterns).

## Development

Brightlayer UI is also a development platform. This platform is intended to help development teams work quickly and efficiently by providing recommendations for technologies, tools/libraries, approaches to common challenges, as well as re-usable components. We support a variety of technologies to give your team the flexibility to choose what will work best for you.

-   To learn about the technologies we support, check out our [Web](/development/frameworks-web/intro) or [Mobile](/development/frameworks-mobile/intro) technology pages.
-   To learn about the different resources provided by Brightlayer UI, see our [Resources](/resources/developer) page.
