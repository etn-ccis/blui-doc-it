# Foundations

Charts are a common data visualization solution, and they are a part of many Eaton products 
and interfaces. In this page you can learn about the elements that compose our chart components, 
how they relate to each other and the design rules to put these elements together.

## Building Blocks

<ImageGrid images={[Chart]} regularWidth />

<BLCAccordian
  heading='1. Legends'
  content={
    <span>
      Legends have two functions in Brightlayer Charts. They provide the key to understanding the plot area, and also
      work as toggles to show / hide datasets individually. <br />
      <br />
      Using a legend is optional if you are displaying a single dataset, as long as the chart title provides enough
      context for the user.
      <br />
      <br />
      By default, legends appears on top of the plot area but you can use it at the bottom or displayed vertically besides
      the chart, according to your design needs.
    </span>
  }
/>
<BLCAccordian
  heading='2. Date range'
  content={
    <span>
      This field shows the span of the date range currently being displayed on the chart, and changes automatically as
      users swap from day to Week / Month / Year.
    </span>
  }
/>
<BLCAccordian
  heading='3. Tooltip'
  content={
    <span>
      <span>
        Appearing when you hover elements inside the plot area, tooltips show more detailed information about a single
        or multiple datasets, connecting the data points in both axis to the specific location you are hovering in the
        plot area. There are two variants for the Tooltip component:
      </span>
      <span style={{display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', marginTop: '1rem'}}>
        <span style={{display: 'flex', marginBottom: '1rem'}}>
          <span style={{display: 'block'}}>&#x2022;</span>
          <span style={{marginLeft: '1rem',}}>
            <b>Multiple values</b> - To be used on Line and Bar charts, whenever a user can hover a data point that has
            more than one dataset associated with it.
          </span>
        </span>
        <span style={{display: 'flex'}}>
          <span style={{display: 'block'}}>&#x2022;</span>
          <span  style={{marginLeft: '1rem'}}>
            <b>Single value</b> - To be used on Pie charts or smaller versions of other charts, whenever a user hovers a
            datapoint that has only one dataset associated with it OR smaller chart sizes that require a smaller
            tooltip.
          </span>
        </span>
      </span>
    </span>
  }
/>
<BLCAccordian
  heading='4. Grid'
  content={
    <span>
      A combination of dotted lines aligned horizontally and/or vertically with the Y-Axis and X-Axis values creates a
      grid, which appears in the background of the plot area, making it easier for users to associate data points in a
      plot with their correct axis values.
      <br />
      When hovering a specific value in the plot area, the vertical grid line associated with it is replaced by a full
      thicker line, to give emphasis to the value we are reading.
    </span>
  }
/>
<BLCAccordian
  heading='5. Plot area'
  content={
    <span>
      This is where your data will be displayed, as points placed in the cartesian plane between the two axis. The plot
      area can present single or multiple data sets.
      <br />
      In the background of the plot area, grid lines support connecting your data values to the axis for better
      interpretation.
    </span>
  }
/>
<BLCAccordian
  heading='6. Predicted values'
  content={
    <span>
      In Brightlayer Charts, dashed lines indicate predicted values. This means forecast data is being used to project
      the expected behaviour for data sets. They are used in combination with a reference line (read more below) that
      indicates the Current Time, so that users can clearly make a distinction between historical (past) and forecast
      (future) data.
      <br />
      <br />
      To use this feature, your project needs to have both forecast and actual data, either two separate datasets or two
      separate items in the same dataset.
    </span>
  }
/>
<BLCAccordian
  heading='7. Underlays'
  content={
    <span>
      <span>
        Underlays are a useful resource to convey additional context in a chart. They consist of a multi-colored layer
        that sits under the Plot area, with horizontal or vertical subdivisions determined by specific values in the X
        or Y axis. These colors are used to visually represent system features, such as thresholds and average values.
        <br />
        <br />
        Underlays are currently available for Line charts only, in two different presets:
      </span>
      <span style={{display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', marginTop: '1rem'}}>
        <span style={{display: 'flex', paddingBottom: '1rem', marginBottom: '1rem'}}>
          <span style={{display: 'block'}}>&#x2022;</span>
          <span style={{marginLeft: '1rem'}}>
            <b>Solar forecasting</b> - using weather forecast data, the chart displays a background vertically split
            into 2 areas: light blue for Night time and light yellow for Day time. The precise length of these
            backgrounds is a variable, determined by factors such as time of the year and geographical position.
          </span>
        </span>
        <span style={{display: 'flex', paddingBottom: '1rem', marginBottom: '1rem'}}>
          <span style={{display: 'block'}}>&#x2022;</span>
          <span style={{marginLeft: '1rem'}}>
            <b>Healthy range</b> - an underlay that conveys critical information to users regarding safety thresholds.
            The background is horizontally split into 3 areas: Safe (light green), Warning (light yellow) and Critical
            (light red). It can be used in tandem with Reference lines to ensure users understand the meaning of the
            colors.
          </span>
        </span>
      </span>
      <span>
        To customise the design of charts that use underlays, designers will need to detach the component instance and
        resize these areas manually. In Storybook, this variable can be manipulated with a dedicated control.
      </span>
    </span>
  }
/>
<BLCAccordian
  heading='8. Reference lines'
  content={
    <span>
      <span>
        Reference lines are guides placed in the Overlays section of components, similarly to the Tooltip. They can add
        a layer of related information to the chart, or indicate additional values that users should be mindful of when
        examining the data.
        <br />
        <br />
        Reference lines are available in <b>Horizontal</b> and <b>Vertical</b> versions. The Vertical variant also includes
        two styles, <b>Chip Label</b> and <b>Text Label</b>.<br />
        <br />
        Some examples of using Reference lines in Eaton products include:
      </span>
      <br />
      <br />
      <span style={{display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column'}}>
        <span style={{display: 'flex', paddingBottom: '1rem', marginBottom: '1rem'}}>
          <span style={{display: 'block'}}>&#x2022;</span>
          <span style={{display: 'block', marginLeft: '1rem'}}>
            <b>Limits / thresholds</b> - a Horizontal reference line that indicates preset values such as Safe /
            Critical / Warning, Minimum or Maximum and others
          </span>
        </span>
        <span style={{display: 'flex', paddingBottom: '1rem', marginBottom: '1rem'}}>
          <span style={{display: 'block'}}>&#x2022;</span>
          <span style={{display: 'block', marginLeft: '1rem'}}>
            <b>Current Time</b> - a Vertical reference lines that moves along the X-Axis as the day goes by, to help
            users make a distinction between historical and forecast data (also indicated by solid and dashed lines)
          </span>
        </span>
        <span style={{display: 'flex'}}>
          <span style={{display: 'block'}}>&#x2022;</span>
          <span style={{display: 'block', marginLeft: '1rem'}}>
            <b>Average</b> - a Horizontal reference that indicates the average values for data points in the Y-Axis. The
            average value can be calculated using the time period being displayed on the chart, or an all-time average.
          </span>
        </span>
      </span>
    </span>
  }
/>

## Data granularity

Charts commonly include the option to browse historical data, going back in time or zooming out to display data points 
spread across a day, a week, a month or a year. This is a high value feature for our end users, as it allows them to 
identify patterns and obtain additional insights.  
  
In Brightlayer UI charts, this process of data wrangling is done through 
our Data Granularity component, made using icons and components from Brightlayer UI:

<ImageGrid images={[DataGranularity]} regularWidth />

<BLCAccordian
  heading='1. Previous / Next buttons'
  content={
    <span>
      Clicking these buttons will update the chart to show the corresponding data points for the new date range that has been selected.
    </span>
  }
/>
<BLCAccordian
  heading='2. Axis'
  content={
    <span>
      The X-Axis and Y-Axis provide units of measure and a context of proportion to the datasets illustrated in the plot
      area.
      <br />
      <br />
      Usually, axis are placed in two locations:
      <br />
      <span style={{display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', marginTop: '1rem'}}>
        <span style={{display: 'flex', marginBottom: '1rem', paddingBottom: '1rem'}}>
          <span style={{display: 'block'}}>&#x2022;</span>
          <span style={{marginLeft: '1rem'}}>
            Y-Axis is placed vertically on the left or right of the chart and is often used to display sequential values
            (such as 10kW, 20kW, 30kW).
          </span>
        </span>
        <span style={{display: 'flex', marginBottom: '1rem', paddingBottom: '1rem'}}>
          <span style={{display: 'block'}}>&#x2022;</span>
          <span style={{marginLeft: '1rem'}}>
            X-Axis is placed horizontally below the chart and is often used to display time intervals (such as 08:00,
            09:00, 10:00).
          </span>
        </span>
      </span>
      It’s common practice to use abbreviated labels on both axis in order to save space. You can use the first three
      letters of the word for months and days of the week (such as Mon, Tue, Wed or Jan, Feb, Mar).
      <br />
      <br />
      Avoid using long labels on the Y-Axis, as this will affect the look and functionality of both the chart and the tooltip
      component.
      <br />
      <br />
      The Brightlayer Charts sticker sheet includes additional unit options, which in Figma are available by selecting
      the Axis component (within the chart layers) and changing its variant.
    </span>
  }
/>
<BLCAccordian
  heading='3. Granularity toggle'
  content={
    <span>
      There are many different ways to use this toggle. In some cases, the chart might change from Line to Bar when
      users swap from Day to Week / Month / Year. The units and the amount of data points on the X and Y-Axis are also
      subject to change. All of these options depend on the datasets that are available to use in your charts.
    </span>
  }
/>

## Chart sizes

Our Figma sticker sheet offers each chart in three different sizes.  
<div style={{paddingTop: '0.5rem'}}></div>
Picking the appropriate size is important, as it ensures a more seamless integration with dashboards built using components 
from Brightlayer UI.  
<div style={{paddingTop: '0.5rem'}}></div>
The Medium and Small components in the Figma sticker sheet include limited features compared to their Large versions. This 
is a conscious decision based on our research and user testing: as the chart size shrinks, less space is available to display 
all the relevant information inside the plot area.  
<div style={{paddingTop: '0.5rem'}}></div>
If your product requires additional options for Medium or Small charts, both our Figma and Storybook components can be locally 
customised by your team.  
<div style={{paddingTop: '0.5rem'}}></div>
When choosing the appropriate size of your chart, consider the following:

<div style={{paddingTop: '0.5rem'}}></div>
**Large - 960 x 600px** To be used on desktop, spanning the full width of available screen space. This is the best
version if you want to avail of advanced features such as Forecasting and Underlays.

<div style={{paddingTop: '0.5rem'}}></div>

**Medium - 420 x 300px**  
To be used on desktop or tablet, spanning 4-6 columns of your grid.

<div style={{paddingTop: '0.5rem'}}></div>

**Small - 320 x 200px**  
To be used on desktop, tablet or mobile, spanning 3 columns of your grid (full width on mobile).
