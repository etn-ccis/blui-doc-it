# Foundations

Charts are a common data visualization solution, and they are a part of many Eaton products 
and interfaces. In this page you can learn about the elements that compose our chart components, 
how they relate to each other and the design rules to put these elements together.

## Building Blocks

<ImageGrid images={[Chart]} regularWidth />

<BLCAccordian
  heading='1. Legends'
  content={
    <span>
      Legends have two functions in Brightlayer Charts. They provide the key to understanding the plot area, and also
      work as toggles to show / hide datasets individually. <br />
      <br />
      Using a legend is optional if you are displaying a single dataset, as long as the chart title provides enough
      context for the user.
      <br />
      <br />
      By default, legends appears on top of the plot area but you can use it at the bottom or displayed vertically besides
      the chart, according to your design needs.
    </span>
