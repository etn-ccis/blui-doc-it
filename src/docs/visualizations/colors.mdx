# Colors in Data Visualization

The colors used in Eaton visualizations are a subset of the Eaton color palette. 
They are part of the  [Eaton Branding Guidelines](https://eaton.sharepoint.com/sites/CommunicationsBrandCenter), 
and all charts added to Eaton interfaces follow the same rules.

## Color Tokens

Our data viz components make use of the color tokens listed in the Brightlayer UI sticker sheet. This allows 
automatic switching between Light and Dark modes, and ensure your designs are always using standard Eaton 
palettes. We offer token support to 5 of the 16 Branding colors.

**Data Series** - these are the hues from the Branding palette that we recommend using for data viz, for having 
the best contrast relationships and accessibility scores.

These tokens are also ordered from 1 to 5, which is the preferred order of use:  
\- If you need a single color Bar chart, we recommend using Data Series 1.  
\- If your Line chart displays 3 lines, we recommend using Data Series 1, 2 and 3.

If you want to use more than 5 hues in a single chart, feel free to use colors from the 
[Branding palette](https://brightlayer-ui.github.io/style/color#branding-colors) at your discretion. For most 
cases, we recommend using the 500 values.

<ColorRowBlock
label={'Data Series'}
col1={[
    { color: '#005EB8', label: 'Data Series 1' },
    { color: '#FFC72C', label: 'Data Series 2' },
    { color: '#ED8B00', label: 'Data Series 3' },
    { color: '#B5BD00', label: 'Data Series 4' },
    { color: '#4C8D2B', label: 'Data Series 5' },

col2={[
    { color: '#FFFFFF', label: 'On Data Series 1' },
    { color: '#524700', label: 'On Data Series 2' },
    { color: '#4B2800', label: 'On Data Series 3' },
    { color: '#524700', label: 'On Data Series 4' },
    { color: '#FFFFFF', label: 'On Data Series 5' },
]}
/>

**Axis and Grids** - These are the color tokens used on ancillary elements of charts, such as axis, grids and 
reference lines.

<ColorRowBlock
label={'Axis and Grids'}
col1={[
    { color: '#192024', label: 'Axis' },
]}
col2={[
    { color: '#74777F40', label: 'Grid Line' },
]}
/>

**Underlays** - These are the color tokens used on the Underlay component, which conveys additional data insights 
by outlining data ranges through the use of color.

<ColorRowBlock
label={'Underlays'}
col1={[
    { color: '#BA1B1A1A', label: 'Underlay Danger' },
    { color: '#1989001A', label: 'Underlay Healthy' },
    { color: '#71B2C914', label: 'Underlay Night' },
]}
col2={[
    { color: '#FBE3651A', label: 'Underlay Warning' },
    { color: '#FFC72C14', label: 'Underlay Day' },
]}
/>

# Color Guidelines

Color has a substantial influence on how quickly and accurately the audience derives meaning from data. When 
used correctly, color can help communicate the following;

## Consistency

Using our recommended color palette ensures user experience is consistent across different products and systems. 
Within a given product or dashboard, ensure that the meaning associated with each color is consistent through all 
screens.

<ImageGrid
    images={[Consistency]}
    regularWidth
    caption='The meaning associated with Purple (EV Chargers) stays consistent throughout different charts'
/>

## Data Relationships

Color can be used to communicate the relationship between data. Related data should have similar colors, and unrelated 
data should have distinct colors.

<ImageGrid
    images={[datarel1, datarel2]}
    captionsUnderImages={[
        'Bar charts showing related \n data use a single color',
        'Donut charts use distinct colors for quick understanding'
    ]}
/>
  
# Information Hierarchy

Color can effectively communicate the information hierarchy of data visuals by making the most important information 
vibrant and eye-catching, and the less important information muted (Gray 200).



<ImageGrid
    images={[infohierarchy1, infohierarchy2]}
    captionsUnderImages={[
        'Line chart using a highlight to guide storytelling and help users focus on most relevant info',
        'Bar chart with a single bar highlighted to represent This Week (past weeks are shown in grey for reference)'
    ]}
