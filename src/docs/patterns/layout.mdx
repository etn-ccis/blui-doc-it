# Page Layout Patterns

<ImageGrid regularWidth images={[LayoutBanner]} />

The layout is one of the most fundamental aspects of your application - it's how you place and position all of the different elements on your page. It's also one of the most important aspects when building your application to be responsive and usable on a variety of different devices and screen sizes.

<MaterialDesignDescription title={'Layout'} url={`https://m2.material.io/design/layout/understanding-layout.html`} />

> **NOTE:** Brightlayer UI does not support the use of Twitter Bootstrap for Brightlayer UI applications. Bootstrap can cause conflicts with Brightlayer UI components and themes and is an unnecessary addition next to the Material component libraries and frameworks supported by Brightlayer UI. If you are accustomed to using Bootstrap for layout, you can read about the Brightlayer UI alternative approach below.

## Angular

If you are building an Angular application, we recommend you use [Angular Flex Layout](https://github.com/angular/flex-layout) to build your application. This is the default layout library for Angular applications and is built and supported by the Angular team. Some of the main benefits of this library are:

-   Seamless integration with Angular and Angular Material
-   Support on all major browsers
-   Greater flexibility and control than a static grid system
-   Responsive layout capability (e.g., show/hide elements, dynamically apply classes, etc. based on screen size)

You can see examples of how to do various layouts on the Angular Flex Layout website ([static](https://tburleson-layouts-demos.firebaseapp.com/#/docs), [responsive](https://tburleson-layouts-demos.firebaseapp.com/#/responsive)).

## React

Material-UI for React applications provides a built-in [layout](https://mui.com/guides/responsive-ui/) mechanism, based on CSS flexbox. It allows you to build layouts based on CSS Grids, standard flexbox CSS, or a combination. Some of the main benefits of this library are:

-   Built-in Grid components, based on Material Design 12-column layout
-   Custom flexbox rules for more control
-   Responsive layout capability (e.g., show/hide elements, dynamic styling rules, etc. based on screen size)

You can see examples of how to do various Grid layouts on the [MUI](https://mui.com/components/grid/) website.
