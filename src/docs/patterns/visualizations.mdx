# Visualizations

<ImageGrid regularWidth images={[VisualizationBanner]} />

Data is the foundation of most Brightlayer UI applications, but many users are not interested in looking at the raw data. Visualizations allow you to present this data in a (visual) way that is easier to understand and allows users to draw conclusions and take actions based on the data. The most common visualizations in Brightlayer UI applications are charts / graphs and maps.

<React.Fragment>
    <TOC
        anchors={[
            { title: 'Introduction', hash: '#visualizations' },
            { title: 'Charts / Graphs', hash: '#charts--graphs' },
            { title: 'Maps', hash: '#maps' },
            { title: 'Mobile Charting', hash: '#mobile-charting' },
            { title: 'Developers', hash: '#developers' },
        ]}

# Charts / Graphs

<ImageGrid
    images={[LineChart, PieChart]}
    caption={[
        '1: Line charts represent time-series data changing over a period of time.',
        '2: Pie / ring charts show a single value as a proportion of an expected or ideal total.',
    ]}
/>

Charts and graphs come in [many different forms](https://material.io/design/communication/data-visualization.html#types). Depending on the expected interaction, these can be large elements on the UI — such as full-screen line chart with numerous series — or small supporting elements like a pie chart embedded in a card.

    url={`https://material.io/design/communication/data-visualization.html`}

@TODO: update those examples with recommendations from the designers (brightlayer-ui-1613)

> The following examples merely serve to show how to bring the charting libraries into your application and adjust some of the common chart parameters. You will want to adjust these values to meet the design requirements of your application.

<DemoCard
    repository={'highcharts'}
    angular={`https://stackblitz.com/github/brightlayer-ui/highcharts/tree/master/angular-demo#`}
    react={`https://codesandbox.io/s/github/brightlayer-ui/highcharts/tree/master/react-demo#`}

To avoid interfering with other UI elements, charts should be built using the Brightlayer UI [branding](/style/color#branding-colors) color palette.

<React.Fragment>
    <ImageGrid
        images={[UsePrimaryColorDo, UsePrimaryColorDont]}
        captionsUnderImages={[
            'DO: Use branding colors for charts.',
            'DONT: Never use the UI color palette for charts.',
        ]}
    />
    <ImageGrid
        images={[ClockwisePie]}
        regularWidth
        caption={'A pie chart should always be clockwise, as it reflects the clock rotating direction.'}
    />
    <MaterialDesignDescription
        title={'Internationalization'}
        url={'/patterns/internationalization'}
        description={`Follow Brightlayer UI's guideline for mirroring UI contents.`}
        avatar={<PxblueSmallAltIcon style={{ width: 48, height: 48 }} />}
    />
    <Divider />
</React.Fragment>

# Maps

<ImageGrid
    regularWidth
    images={[MapsImg]}
    caption={[
        'A simple geographic map using the dark theme.',
        'The embedded map is a screenshot from OpenStreetMap, licensed under CC-BY-SA 2.0.',
    ]}
/>
<DemoCard
    repository={'mapbox'}
    angular={`https://stackblitz.com/github/brightlayer-ui/mapbox/tree/master/angular-demo#`}
    react={`https://codesandbox.io/s/github/brightlayer-ui/mapbox/tree/master/react-demo#`}
/>

Maps are used to represent spatial or geographical data. Typically they are used to plot sets of locations or facilities that a user is responsible for.

Maps are usually full-screen elements and are interactive via scrolling, panning, zooming, etc.

# Mobile Charting

There are not as many charting libraries available for React Native applications as there are for web apps. Additionally, the feature-set of mobile charting libraries may not be as rich as their web counterparts. Brightlayer UI recommends [Victory Native](https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/docs/native/) as a viable library to consider when implementing graphs within a mobile app due to its relative popularity and clear documentation.

# Developers

There are many libraries and services for data visualizations. Brightlayer UI currently provides themes / utilities for the following libraries:

**React**:

-   Brightlayer Charts

    -   We recommend you to use [Brightlayer Charts](https://brightlayer-charts.azurewebsites.net/) for data visualizations.

-   Brightlayer Charts Storybook

    -   [Brightlayer Charts Storybook](https://brightlayer-charts-storybook.azurewebsites.net/) offers interactive code and documentation for developing scalable, efficient, and on-brand data visualizations.

**React Native**:

-   Charts & Graphs
