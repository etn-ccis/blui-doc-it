# Visualizations

<ImageGrid regularWidth images={[VisualizationBanner]} />

Data is the foundation of most Brightlayer UI applications, but many users are not interested in looking at the raw data. Visualizations allow you to present this data in a (visual) way that is easier to understand and allows users to draw conclusions and take actions based on the data. The most common visualizations in Brightlayer UI applications are charts / graphs and maps.

<React.Fragment>
    <TOC
        anchors={[
            { title: 'Introduction', hash: '#visualizations' },
            { title: 'Charts / Graphs', hash: '#charts--graphs' },
            { title: 'Maps', hash: '#maps' },
            { title: 'Mobile Charting', hash: '#mobile-charting' },
            { title: 'Developers', hash: '#developers' },
        ]}
    />
    <Divider />
</React.Fragment>

# Charts / Graphs

<ImageGrid
    images={[LineChart, PieChart]}
    caption={[
        '1: Line charts represent time-series data changing over a period of time.',
        '2: Pie / ring charts show a single value as a proportion of an expected or ideal total.',
    ]}
/>

Charts and graphs come in [many different forms](https://m2.material.io/design/communication/data-visualization.html#types). Depending on the expected interaction, these can be large elements on the UI — such as full-screen line chart with numerous series — or small supporting elements like a pie chart embedded in a card.

<MaterialDesignDescription
    title={'Data Visualization'}
    url={`https://m2.material.io/design/communication/data-visualization.html`}
/>

To avoid interfering with other UI elements, charts should be built using the Brightlayer UI [branding](/style/color#branding-colors) color palette.

<React.Fragment>
    <ImageGrid
        images={[UsePrimaryColorDo, UsePrimaryColorDont]}
        captionsUnderImages={[
            'DO: Use branding colors for charts.',
            'DONT: Never use the UI color palette for charts.',
        ]}
    />
    <ImageGrid
        images={[ClockwisePie]}
        regularWidth
        caption={'A pie chart should always be clockwise, as it reflects the clock rotating direction.'}
    />
    <MaterialDesignDescription
        title={'Internationalization'}
        url={'/patterns/internationalization'}
        description={`Follow Brightlayer UI's guideline for mirroring UI contents.`}
        avatar={<PxblueSmallAltIcon style={{ width: 48, height: 48 }} />}
    />
    <Divider />
</React.Fragment>

# Maps

<ImageGrid
    regularWidth
    images={[MapsImg]}
    caption={[
        'A simple geographic map using the dark theme.',
        'The embedded map is a screenshot from OpenStreetMap, licensed under CC-BY-SA 2.0.',
    ]}
/>

Maps are used to represent spatial or geographical data. Typically they are used to plot sets of locations or facilities that a user is responsible for.

Maps are usually full-screen elements and are interactive via scrolling, panning, zooming, etc.

# Mobile Charting

There are not as many charting libraries available for React Native applications as there are for web apps. Additionally, the feature-set of mobile charting libraries may not be as rich as their web counterparts. Brightlayer UI recommends [Victory Native](https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/docs/native/) as a viable library to consider when implementing graphs within a mobile app due to its relative popularity and clear documentation.

# Developers

There are many libraries and services for data visualizations. Brightlayer UI currently recommends themes / utilities for the following libraries:

**React**:

-   [Brightlayer Charts](https://brightlayer-charts.azurewebsites.net/) ([Storybook](https://brightlayer-charts-storybook.azurewebsites.net/))

**React Native**:

-   Charts & Graphs

    -   [Victory Native](https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/docs/native/)
