# Steppers

<ImageGrid images={[StepperBanner]} regularWidth />

Steppers are used to communicate progress through a linear, multi-step workflow or process. They tell users how many steps there are in the process and which step they are on.

# Common Use Cases

You can refer to the Material Design Stepper guidelines for general usage instructions.

Steppers can be used in a variety of ways in your application, including:

-   Wizards
-   Multi-step workflows (e.g., [Authentication](/patterns/user-auth))
-   User-defined procedures
-   Breaking up long [Forms](/patterns/forms)

# Variations

## Basic Stepper

<ImageGrid images={[LinearStepper]} regularWidth />

A basic stepper simply shows the steps that are available and allows the user to navigate between them. There are many possible configurations for a basic stepper, including:

-   Horizontal / Vertical
-   Linear / Non-linear
-   Editable / Non-editable

## Dynamic Stepper

<ImageGrid images={[Dynamic]} regularWidth />

A dynamic stepper is an extension of the basic stepper that allows users to configure their own steps. Typically, an "Add Step" button is included that will insert a new step into the stepper. This is most useful when your application allows users to define their own procedures, such as a sequence of steps for an emergency shutdown.

## Pager

<ImageGrid
    regularWidth
    images={[Pagers]}
    caption={[
        `Pagers used for multi-step workflows in a full-screen bottom sheet on mobile (1) and a desktop overlay (2).`,
    ]}
/>

A pager is a simplified version of a stepper that is used solely to indicate how many steps are in a workflow. This variation of the stepper is non-interactive and does not include any labels for any of the steps / pages. It always appears at the bottom of the screen / sheet (mobile) or dialog / card (desktop).
