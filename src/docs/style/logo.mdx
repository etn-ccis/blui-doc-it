# App Logos

App logos are the primary way users identify an app or a product. Not only do they appear on users' app launcher screens, app logos are also present in app markets like App Store and Google Play, the company's product pages, browser tabs, browser home pages, emails, and the app itself. They serve a critical function in a product's identity.

Eaton product teams should follow this app logo guideline to determine their app logo. For the most part, you should be utilizing app logo templates from Brightlayer UI (linked below) while keeping in mind requirements from different platforms. You should ensure that the final design is simple, recognizable, and scalable.

# App Logos, Icons, and Pictograms

<!-- This section is adapted directly from icon guidelines. If you change something here, you may need to change it in the other file. -->

<ImageGrid
    images={[ExampleOfLogo, ExampleOfIcon, ExampleOfPictogram]}

This guide talks specifically about the design of app logos, which should not be confused with other glyphs, such as icons and pictograms. App logos, sometimes referred to as "app icons", are symbols of products and apps, usually protected under trademark laws. [Icons](/style/icon-guidelines) symbolize common actions, objects, or ideas used to aid users. Pictograms are typically used on websites for decorative purposes only.

> Note: if you need to use logos from other companies — such as a payment processor — make sure that you are compliant with their branding guidelines.

# Examples

Below are some existing app logos used at Eaton.

# Anatomy

A standard Eaton app logo consists of three parts:

# Design Steps

## Tools

We recommend vector graphics design tools such as Adobe Illustrator and Figma to design your product logo. Raster graphic tools such as Adobe Photoshop might occasionally be useful for final touches, but they are not designed for vector graphics. Do not use raster graphics tools such as Adobe Photoshop to design the foundation, because they are specialized in generating raster graphics that are not scalable.

You are able to generate image assets at different resolutions to meet the need of different platforms. There are also online tools, such as [App Icon Generator](https://www.appicon.co/), to help with this process.

Some platforms may have specialized tools to preview the app logo. Android, for example, encourages developers to create adaptive icons using [Android Studio's Image Asset Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/image-asset-studio#create-adaptive). Amazon Alexa has a web tool,[Alexa Icon Builder](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/2018/08/create-eye-catching-icons-for-your-alexa-skills-in-minutes1), to allow users to generate Alexa Skill logos quickly.

## Glyph

A glyph is a simple shape representing an object, action, or idea. Your glyph must be simple, recognizable, and scalable to ensure that your app can be easily identified on multiple devices with different resolutions.

We recommend you select your base glyph from our [icon library](/style/icon-library).

<ImageGrid
    images={[Glyph1, Glyph2]}
    captionsUnderImages={[
        `AVOID: Avoid the use of mnemonic logos or logotypes when possible. They are often not meaningful for first-time users, and can be hard to see in small logo sizes.`,
        `DO: Use a graphical way to represent an application or product.`,
    ]}
/>

Do not use the Eaton logo as a glyph — your app should not be presented as the "Eaton" app. It is not unusual for a customer to have multiple Eaton products and applications installed on their devices, and if every one of those apps used the Eaton logo it becomes very difficult for a user to tell, at a glance, which application they are looking for.

<ImageGrid images={[Glyph3]} captionsUnderImages={[`DONT: Do not use the Eaton logo as glyphs.`]} />

You should also verify that your product logo is distinguished enough from other existing Eaton product logos.

Glyphs are usually aligned to the keyline (visible in the template) to avoid bleeding beyond the safe zone.

<ImageGrid images={[GlyphKeyline]} captionsUnderImages={[`Align glyphs to the icon template keyline.`]} regularWidth />

Once the base glyph is decided, you can be creative and add variations to the glyph to make it look more designed.

<ImageGrid
    images={[PolishGlyph1, PolishGlyph2]}
    captionsUnderImages={[
        `Smart Energy Manager modified the glyph shape to accommodate for a bolt glyph inside.`,
        `Predict Pulse modified the glyph size, opacity, and image gradient.`,
    ]}
/>

## Background

Most Eaton app logos use [the primary blue](/style/color?category=ui&name=blue&weight=500) as the base background color. Some also select the background color from one of the [branding colors](/style/color#branding-colors) to stay consistent with colors in their product marketing.

<ImageGrid
    images={[Background1]}
    captionsUnderImages={[`Use the primary blue or one of the branding colors as a foundation for the background.`]}
    regularWidth
/>

<ImageGrid
    images={[Background2, Background3]}
    captionsUnderImages={[
        `DONT: Do not use a photo in the logo.`,
        `DONT: Do not use a screenshot or app UI in the logo.`,
    ]}
/>

<ImageGrid
    images={[BackgroundGradient1, BackgroundGradient2, BackgroundGradient3]}
    captionsUnderImages={[
        `DO: Most Eaton apps choose to add a subtle corner linear gradient to their app logo background.`,
        `Apps may also consider using a centered radial gradient, especially when the glyph has a round shape.`,
        `A monochromatic background is acceptable.`,
    ]}
    gridImageProps={{ sm: 6, md: 4 }}
/>

## Bottom Badge

The bottom badges are not meant to be modified. You are expected to leave the bottom badge as it is in the logo templates.

<ImageGrid
    images={[BottomBadge1, BottomBadge2, BottomBadge3, BottomBadge4, BottomBadge5]}
    captionsUnderImages={[
        `DO: Use the default badge as it is.`,
        `DONT: Don't modify the badge color.`,
        `DONT: Don't modify the badge logo color.`,
        `DONT: Don't modify the badge size or the logo size.`,
        `DONT: Don't modify the badge effects or add shadows.`,
    ]}
    gridImageProps={{ sm: 6, md: 4 }}
/>

## Export

When exporting to different platforms, ensure that your logo design is following the platform-specific requirement [as listed below](#logo-requirements-by-platforms).

When exporting to specific resolutions it is sometimes helpful to tweak vector shapes so that they fall on exact pixels, a process also known as "pixel hinting". This helps maintain a “crisp” look and avoids the blurriness that may occur when edges are in between pixels.

<ImageGrid
    images={[PixelHinting1, PixelHinting2, PixelHinting3]}
    captionsUnderImages={[
        `The original app logo design.`,
        `When this design is shrinked to a small size, the details become illegible.`,
        `Pixel-hinting helps sharpening the app logo at low resolutions.`,
    ]}
    caption={`Pixel hinting is helpful for app logos at low resolutions.`}
    gridImageProps={{ sm: 6, md: 4 }}
/>

Do not export rounded corners and drop shadows to your final design assets. You are encouraged to preview the logo design with these effects enabled, but your final exported assets should be square-shaped.

# Logo Requirements by Platforms

<ImageGrid
    images={[LogosOnDifferentPlatforms]}
    caption={[
        `App logos look different on different platforms.`,
        `1: The original design.`,

## Favicons

Favicons are product logos for web apps. They can appear in browser tabs, task bars, bookmarks, and phone screens just like native mobile apps, under various image sizes. We highly recommend redesigning the app logo specifically for the favicon to ensure that it shows well at all resolutions.

According to [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/resources/favicon-size/), the optimal favicon dimensions are as follows, in pixels:

-   Browser tab favicons - 16×16
-   Taskbar shortcut icons - 32×32
-   Desktop shortcut icons - 96×96
-   Apple touch icons - 180×180

Developers should [include multiple favicons](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/what-is-a-favicon) for these different resolutions in the HTML head to accommodate for different favicon usage.

Favicons used in browser tabs and taskbar shortcuts resemble the original product logo design, but with the badge removed. It always has the background color to ensure that the glyph can be seen clearly.

<ImageGrid
    images={[Favicon]}
    caption={[
        `Favicon needs to be recognizable at a size as small as 16×16 pixels.`,
        `1: The original product logo, with the bottom badge removed to allow more room for the glyph.`,
        `2: The same logo, rendered at 16×16, a favicon size used in browser tabs.`,
        `3: Optionally, you can consider doing "pixel-hinting" — manually editing the favicon to ensure that it renders well at low resolution.`,
        `4: The favicon in a browser tab.`,
    ]}
    regularWidth
/>

Desktop shortcuts and Apple touch icons should resemble the design of standard app logos.

# Design Specifications

The templates should already have everything you need. However, if you want to do something fancy, here's the design spec for a default logo:

<ImageGrid
    images={[Spec, SpecCircle, SpecColor]}
    captionsUnderImages={[
        `A regular app logo.`,
        `For platforms using round app logo shapes, such as Android's adaptive icon and Amazon Alexa Skills, the Eaton logo in the badge is shrunk to remain visible.`,
        `The glyph should not be brighter than white[50] (pure white) at 90% to avoid looking too glaring.`,
    ]}
/>
