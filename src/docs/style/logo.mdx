# App Logos

App logos are the primary way users identify an app or a product. Not only do they appear on app launcher screens, but app logos are also present in app markets like the Apple App Store and Google Play, the company's product pages, browser tabs, browser home pages, emails, and within the app itself. They serve a critical function in a product's identity.

Eaton applications should follow these guidelines to create their app logo. The simplest way to do this is by using one of the provided app logo templates from Brightlayer UI (linked below) while keeping in mind requirements from different application platforms. You should ensure that your final design is simple, recognizable, and scalable.

# App Logos, Icons, and Pictograms

{/* This section is adapted directly from icon guidelines. If you change something here, you may need to change it in the other file. */}

<ImageGrid
    images={[ExampleOfLogo, ExampleOfIcon, ExampleOfPictogram]}

This guide deals specifically with the design of app logos, which should not be confused with other glyphs, such as icons and pictograms. App logos, sometimes referred to as "app icons", are symbols of products and apps, usually protected under trademark laws. [Icons](/style/icon-guidelines) symbolize common actions, objects, or ideas used to aid users. Pictograms are typically used on websites for decorative purposes only.

> Note: if you need to use logos from other companies — such as a payment processor — make sure that you are compliant with their branding guidelines.

# Examples

Below are some existing app logos used at Eaton.

# Anatomy

A standard Eaton app logo consists of three parts:

# Design Steps

## Tools

We recommend using vector graphics design tools such as Adobe Illustrator or Figma to design your product logo. Raster graphic tools such as Adobe Photoshop might occasionally be useful for final touches, but they are not designed for vector graphics. They should not be used to design your logo's foundation because raster graphics are not scalable.

Different app platforms have different requirements for image sizes — you will need to generate your logo at different resolutions to meet these requirements. There are online tools, such as [App Icon Generator](https://www.appicon.co/), to help automate this process.

Some platforms may have specialized tools to preview the app logo. Android, for example, encourages developers to create adaptive icons using [Android Studio's Image Asset Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/image-asset-studio#create-adaptive). Amazon Alexa has a web tool, [Alexa Icon Builder](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/2018/08/create-eye-catching-icons-for-your-alexa-skills-in-minutes1), to allow users to generate Alexa Skill logos quickly.

## Background

Most Eaton app logos use [the primary blue](/style/color?category=ui&name=blue&weight=500) as the base background color. Some also select the background color from one of the [branding colors](/style/color#branding-colors) to stay consistent with colors in their product marketing.

<ImageGrid

    captionsUnderImages={[
        `DONT: Do not use a photo in the logo.`,
        `DONT: Do not use a screenshot or app UI in the logo.`,
    ]}
/>

<ImageGrid
    images={[BackgroundGradient1, BackgroundGradient2, BackgroundGradient3]}
    captionsUnderImages={[
        `DO: Most Eaton apps choose to add a subtle diagonal linear gradient to their app logo background.`,
        `Apps may also consider using a centered radial gradient, especially when the glyph has a round shape.`,
        `A monochromatic background is acceptable.`,
    ]}
    gridImageProps={{ sm: 6, md: 4 }}
/>

## Glyph

A glyph is a simple shape representing an object, action, or idea. Your glyph must be simple, recognizable, and scalable to ensure that your app can be easily identified on multiple devices with different resolutions.

We recommend you select your base glyph from our [icon library](/style/icon-library).

<ImageGrid
    images={[Glyph1, Glyph2]}
    captionsUnderImages={[
        `AVOID: Avoid the use of mnemonic logos or logotypes when possible. They are often not meaningful for first-time users, and can be hard to see in small logo sizes.`,
        `DO: Use a graphical way to represent an application or product.`,
    ]}
/>

Do not use the Eaton logo as a glyph — your app should not be presented as the "Eaton" app. It is not unusual for a customer to have multiple Eaton products and applications installed on their devices — if every one of those apps used the Eaton logo it would be very difficult for a user to differentiate them.

<ImageGrid images={[Glyph3]} captionsUnderImages={[`DONT: Do not use the Eaton logo as glyphs.`]} />

You should also verify that your product logo is distinguished enough from other existing Eaton product logos. [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/eaton-corporation/id439590491) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Eaton) are good places to start, but keep in mind that not all logos in these two places are following our app logo guidelines.

Glyphs are usually aligned to the keyline (visible in the template) to avoid bleeding beyond the safe zone.

<ImageGrid images={[GlyphKeyline]} captionsUnderImages={[`Align glyphs to the icon template keyline.`]} regularWidth />

Once you select the base glyph, you can be creative and add variations to the glyph to make it look more designed / stylized.

<ImageGrid
    images={[PolishGlyph1, PolishGlyph2]}
    captionsUnderImages={[
        `Smart Energy Manager modified the glyph shape to add a bolt glyph inside.`,
        `Predict Pulse modified the glyph size, opacity, and image gradient.`,
    ]}
/>

## Bottom Badge

The bottom badges are not meant to be modified. You are expected to leave the bottom badge as it is in the logo templates.

<ImageGrid
    images={[BottomBadge1, BottomBadge2, BottomBadge3, BottomBadge4, BottomBadge5]}
    captionsUnderImages={[
        `DO: Use the default badge as it is. Note that different platforms might have different requirements (see below).`,
        `DONT: Don't modify the badge color.`,
        `DONT: Don't modify the badge logo color.`,
        `DONT: Don't modify the badge size or the logo size.`,
        `DONT: Don't modify the badge effects or add shadows.`,
    ]}
    gridImageProps={{ sm: 6, md: 4 }}
/>

## Export

When exporting for different platforms, ensure that your logo design follows the platform-specific requirements [as listed below](#logo-requirements-by-platforms).

When exporting for specific resolutions it is sometimes helpful to tweak vector shapes so that they fall on exact pixels, a process also known as "pixel hinting". This helps maintain a “crisp” look and avoids the blurriness that may occur when edges are in between pixels.

<ImageGrid
    images={[PixelHinting1, PixelHinting2, PixelHinting3]}
    captionsUnderImages={[
        `The original app logo design.`,
        `When this design is shrinked to a small size, the details become illegible.`,
        `Pixel-hinting helps sharpening the app logo at low resolutions.`,
    ]}
    caption={`Pixel hinting is helpful for app logos at low resolutions.`}
    gridImageProps={{ sm: 6, md: 4 }}
/>

Do not export your final app logo with rounded corners or drop shadows. You are encouraged to preview the logo design with these effects enabled, but your final exported assets should be square-shaped. The additional effects are automatically applied by the application platform.

## Favicons

Favicons are product logos for web apps. They can appear at different sizes in browser tabs, task bars, bookmarks, and on phone screens (like native mobile apps). We highly recommend redesigning the app logo specifically for the favicon to ensure that it shows well at all resolutions.

According to [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/resources/favicon-size/), the optimal favicon dimensions are as follows, in pixels:

-   Browser tab favicons - 16×16
-   Taskbar shortcut icons - 32×32
-   Desktop shortcut icons - 96×96
-   Apple touch icons - 180×180

Developers should [include multiple favicons](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/what-is-a-favicon) for these different resolutions in the HTML head to accommodate these various use cases.

Favicons used in browser tabs and taskbar shortcuts resemble the original product logo design, but with the badge removed. It always has the background color to ensure that the glyph can be seen clearly.

<ImageGrid
    images={[Favicon]}
    caption={[
        `Favicon needs to be recognizable at a size as small as 16×16 pixels.`,
        `1: The original product logo, with the bottom badge removed to allow more room for the glyph.`,
        `2: The same logo, rendered at 16×16, a favicon size used in browser tabs.`,
        `3: Optionally, you can consider doing "pixel-hinting" — manually editing the favicon to ensure that it renders well at low resolution.`,
        `4: The favicon in a browser tab.`,
    ]}
    regularWidth
/>

Desktop shortcuts and Apple touch icons should resemble the design of standard app logos.

# Design Specifications

The provided templates have implemented these specifications for you already, but they are presented here for your reference if you need to make any customizations:

    captionsUnderImages={[
        `A regular app logo.`,
        `For platforms using round app logo shapes, such as Android's adaptive icon and Amazon Alexa Skills, the Eaton logo in the badge is shrunk to remain visible.`,
        `The glyph should not be brighter than white[50] (pure white) at 90% to avoid looking too glaring.`,
    ]}
