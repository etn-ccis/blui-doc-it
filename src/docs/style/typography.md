# Typography Guidelines

In general, refer to the typography guidance for [Material.io](https://material.io/guidelines/style/typography.html#).


## Web

Unlike Material Design, the primary desktop font for Power Xpert Blue is [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?selection.family=Open+Sans) (licensed under [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)). This version contains the complete 897 character set, which includes the standard ISO Latin 1, Latin CE, Greek and Cyrillic character sets. Open Sans was optimized for print, web, and mobile interfaces, and has excellent legibility characteristics in its letterforms.

>Note: if you need to support non-western languages, [Noto Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Sans) is a suitable substitution. For applications that require a monospace font (such as when dealing with numerical data), we recommend [Roboto Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono).

## Mobile
For mobile applications, the best practice is to use the font recommendation for the specific target platform ([Material Design Platform Adaptation](https://material.io/guidelines/platforms/platform-adaptation.html)):
* iOS
    * San Francisco (Primary)
    * San Francisco Mono (Monospace)
* Android
    * Roboto (Primary)
    * Roboto Mono (Monospace)

## Using Typography

### Progressive Example

Effective use of typography must take into account not only the type itself, but also the use of spacing and color to achieve the desired effect. This section will build a progressive example (of an alarm row for a tripped breaker) by incrementally considering these different elements.

To start, you must consider the different types of typographic content in an application, which can include headline, subhead, body text, pull quotes, listings, column headings, as well as other elements – and then design to visually reinforce this hierarchy.

We'll start with unformatted text, set in Open Sans.

#### Type Style

Typeface and weight play a key role in establishing typographic hierarchy, especially for headlines and subheads. Generally speaking, bold, decorative, or more distinctive typestyles command attention and denote importance, but so can an ultra light typeface in the right setting. We'll add some varying weights to the example.

#### Type Size

The viewer’s eye is usually drawn to the largest-sized type first (which is usually, but not always, the headline), and then moves on to other elements. Although headlines most commonly appear at the top of a page, this placement is not a requirement. A well-designed composition will guide the reader to the headline and other important elements no matter where they are located. 

#### Case

The use of all caps in small doses can be an effective way to draw attention and denote importance, particularly for headings or subheads. On the other hand, all caps are known to have reduced readability, so using upper and lowercase is preferable for lengthy settings, including running text.

#### Color

The use of color can either draw attention to or de-emphasize an element. For instance, red type on a page with mostly black text will instantly stand out, while making a less important element gray amidst black text will downplay it. Keep in mind that too much color used in too many instances can create visual confusion, which in turn undermines its effectiveness.

#### Placement & Spacing

The placement of all elements, as well as the space between and around them, is part of the overall hierarchy. Keep the most important information prominent. Place all related elements together, while visually separating others to organize the content.

#### Alignment

How elements are aligned can imply their relative level of significance. Centering, for instance, conveys a sense of importance, and is frequently used for titles, headlines, announcements and invitations. Conversely, running body copy usually calls for less emphasis than headings and subheads, and is commonly set flush left, which is easier to read.

#### White Space

Use white, or negative, space to create emphasis and draw attention to important elements. Resist the temptation to fill up every bit of space on a page, which can create too much “visual noise” that can confuse or fatigue the viewer.

A strong design provides visual cues to lead the viewer through the content. Good typographic hierarchy is essential to communicating the desired message and maximizing the likelihood of its being read and understood.

### Additional Examples

This is an example of how type style and color combine to make it easy to differentiate a data value from units and status.

This example shows typography in use against a darker background. Note how color and weight still come into play to differentiate information.
