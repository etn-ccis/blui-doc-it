# Typography Guidelines

Brightlayer UI builds off of the Material Design system, so in general, you may refer to the typography guidelines presented at Material Design. Below, we cover some of the areas where Brightlayer UI differs from Material Design.

<MaterialDesignDescription
    title={'The Type System'}
    url={'https://material.io/design/typography/the-type-system.html'}
    description={`Material Design's typography guidelines.`}
/>

Unlike Material Design, the primary font for Brightlayer UI is [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?selection.family=Open+Sans) (licensed under [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)). This version contains the complete 897 character set, which includes the standard ISO Latin 1, Latin CE, Greek and Cyrillic character sets. Open Sans was optimized for print, web, and mobile interfaces, and has excellent legibility characteristics in its letter forms.

# Type Scale

Brightlayer UI provides a type scale that includes a range of styles to support the needs of your application. All styles and fonts are available in the design library. See the [Angular](https://material.angular.io/guide/typography) and [React](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-typography/) Material theming documentation for more details for how each framework handles typography.

<TypographyTable />

# Principles

You should use font variations to establish an information hierarchy in your display that guides users' attention from the most important details to the least important. Creating this information hierarchy involves using multiple font properties, including size, weight, and / or color.

<ImageGrid
    images={[TextHierarchy1, TextHierarchy2, TextHierarchy3, TextHierarchy4]}
    caption={[
        'You can manipulate different typography properties to establish hierarchy.',
        '1: Font size',
        '2: Font weight',
        '3: Font color',
        '4: Combination',
    ]}
/>

As you are crafting your designs, you need to understand which content is the most important from your users' perspective and make that the easiest to find on the page.

<ImageGrid
    images={[CompeteAttention1, CompeteAttention2]}
    captionsUnderImages={[
        `DONT: Do not rely solely on font weight changes to indicate an active state. Avoid having auxiliary information (e.g., the circled numbers on the right) compete for users' attention.`,
        `DO: Use clues like background color and radio buttons to clearly communicate the state.`,
    ]}
/>

When changing font colors, make sure to take into consideration the [accessibility](/design/accessibility) of your chosen colors.

<ImageGrid
    images={[StatusColor1, StatusColor2]}
    captionsUnderImages={[
        'CAUTION: Be careful when using status colors for a large body of text, as they have reduced legibility compared to standard text colors.',
        ' Shorter text, such as a list item tag, may be colored to reflect a certain status.',
    ]}
/>

<Divider />

# Customization

The standard styles above should cover most of the typography needs in your application. However, it is unrealistic to presume that these styles will cover _every_ potential use case. Slight customization of these styles — such as changing a font weight for a particular component — is acceptable and expected. In most cases, these can be treated as one-off styling tweaks, rather than an entirely new style. If you find that you are using customized styles in multiple places, [contact us](/community/contactus) so we can consider standardizing these styles or provide alternative recommendations.

Most Brightlayer UI components have been designed to work well with the standard styles. Most often, you'll only need to worry about custom typography styles when you are developing your own product-specific components. Keep in mind that even if you are adjusting font styles, you should still continue to use the Open Sans font family.

## Common Customizations

There are a few specific elements in Brightlayer UI applications that are often customized — to the point that they can be considered alternative standard styles.

### App Bar Subtitle

The most commonly customized style in Brightlayer UI applications is the subtitle in the [App Bar](/patterns/appbar) component. This typically makes use of the Body1 style, but a variety of different styles are acceptable. One favorite is to use 18dp / Light.

<React.Fragment>
    <ImageGrid
        images={[AppBar]}
        regularWidth
        caption={[
            '1: App Bar with the standard typography styles.',
            '2: App Bar with commonly used custom subtitle style.',
        ]}
    />
</React.Fragment>

### Scorecard Header

The standard Scorecard component makes use of custom styles by default: the three lines of text are H6, Body1, and 14dp / Light. You should avoid changing the style for the first line, but the second and third lines can be customized as appropriate.

<React.Fragment>
    <ImageGrid
        images={[ScoreCard]}
        regularWidth
        caption={[
            '1: Scorecard with the standard typography styles.',
            '2: Scorecard with custom text styles on the second and third lines. These styles can be adjusted based on the displayed information.',
        ]}
    />
    <Divider />
</React.Fragment>

# Internationalization

<ImageGrid
    images={[SimplifiedChineseImg]}
    regularWidth
    caption={['Use "Noto Sans CJK SC" font for Simplified Chinese.']}
/>

For non-western languages, we recommend using [Noto Sans](https://www.google.com/get/noto/). You should select the appropriate font variation based on the language(s) you are designing for.

<React.Fragment>
    <MaterialDesignDescription
        title={'Internationalization'}
        url={'/patterns/internationalization'}
        description={`Follow Brightlayer UI's guideline to design your UI for different languages.`}
        avatar={<PxblueSmallAltIcon style={{ width: 48, height: 48 }} />}
    />
    <MaterialDesignDescription
        title={'Language Support'}
        url={'https://material.io/design/typography/language-support.html'}
        description={`Material Design's guideline on typography considerations for global audiences.`}
    />
