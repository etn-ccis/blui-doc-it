# Icons Library

Brightlayer UI is built on top of the Google Material design system, which allows us to take advantage
of their extensive icon library and icon grid. These icons are available automatically when you use one
of our supported Material component frameworks. Brightlayer UI also includes a number of supplemental icons
specific to Brightlayer UI products.

These icons are available in a variety of formats - select an icon below to view its usage instructions.
