# Designing with PX Blue

Using the PX Blue design system as a designer can greatly improve your efficiency and the quality of your products. PX Blue has many patterns and guidelines (color usage, typography, iconography, etc.) to address the most common elements and interactions that you might encounter when designing a product. By following these recommendations and using pre-defined resources from PX Blue, your time is free to focus on the elements that make your project unique. In general, we recommend trying to use PX Blue for 80% of your product's needs.

## What Materials are Available?

PX Blue has design/style guidelines for:

-   [Typography](/style/typography)
-   [Iconography](/style/iconography)
-   [Color Usage](/style/color)
-   [Themes](/style/themes)

In addition to these guidelines, we also provide a [Figma library](https://www.figma.com/community/file/852558784352181868) that gives you access to pre-built styles and assets that you can drag and drop to build designs for your applications.

# General Guidance

The best designs generally start with mobile first, and that's what we recommend as well when working with the PX Blue design system. It's much easier to scale designs up than to scale them down. We also strongly encourage you to perform extensive user research to truly understand your users and their needs, skills, preferences, and tendencies.

## Web Applications

Keep the interface simple - avoid unnecessary elements and ensure the language used for labels and messaging is clear.

Strive for consistency by using pre-defined PX Blue UI elements where possible. By using these elements, your users will feel more familiar and will be able to get things done quickly. You can also help ensure consistency by defining patterns in language, layout, and design that are used throughout the application.

Be purposeful when laying out page content. Consider space and the relationship between items on the page. Structure pages based on importance.

<!--image-->

Use the typography guidelines to create hierarchy and clarity. An effective type hierarchy increases scalability, legibility, and readability.

Ensure that the application provides effective feedback to users. Make sure that you communicate location, actions, changes in state, and errors to users. PX Blue has various UI elements to assist with communicating this information.

<!--image-->

Consider using defaults. If you have a strong understanding of the users of your application, careful planning around default states, actions, and paths can reduce the burden on your users.

## Mobile Applications

Generally, interfaces less than seven inches in width should be treated as a mobile (phone) device. Font styles and layouts should be consistent across devices as much as possible - your product should feel like the same application regardless of the device used to access it. When working with a dedicated mobile app, familiarize yourself with device/platform capabilities and take advantage of these where possible.

<!--image-->

A fundamental principle for mobile design is to include only the information that is necessary. Don't overload the user with excessive information. Mobile devices are a convenient way to quickly consume information on the go and the information presented should reflect this.

<!--image-->

Interfaces greater than seven inches in width should be treated as a tablet device. As with phone devices, font styles and layouts should be consistent across devices in this class. However, you may find it appropriate to have some differences between phone and tablet devices because of the difference in screen real estate.

<!--image-->

Tablet designs should look and feel like a desktop application/website, but they should function like a phone app.

<!--image-->

As technology continues to evolve, it is important to consider scaling for the future. Products such as non-mobile touch screens, interactive displays, automotive displays, and touch screen laptops should be considered during your design phase.

# Contributing

We encourage everyone to provide feedback, new design concepts, patterns, suggestions, or other ideas to help us create the most useful design system for our community. If you would like to contribute back, please [contact us](/community/contactus)!

In order to maintain the quality standards for PX Blue resources, any submissions will be subject to review by the PX Blue maintainers. If your design is made a part of PX Blue, we'll add items onto our backlog to bring them to life in code for developers to use.
