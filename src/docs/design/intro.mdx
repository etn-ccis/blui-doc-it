# Designing with Brightlayer UI

Using the Brightlayer UI design system as a designer can greatly improve your efficiency and the quality of your products. Brightlayer UI has many patterns and guidelines (color usage, typography, iconography, etc.) to address the most common elements and interactions that you might encounter when designing a product. By following these recommendations and using pre-defined resources from Brightlayer UI, your time is free to focus on the elements that make your project unique. In general, we recommend trying to use Brightlayer UI for 80% of your product's needs.

## We use Figma

We host and maintain all [our design assets](/resources/designer) through Figma. Figma is a powerful prototyping tool that facilitates collaboration and sharing of design assets between teams. It can be used on the web, and they also provide a desktop app for Mac and Windows. To use Figma, you will need to [sign up](https://www.figma.com/) for an account.

If this is the first time you've ever used Figma, consider going through {/* <!-- markdown-link-check-disable --> */}[one of its official tutorials](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/sections/4405269443991-Figma-for-Beginners-tutorial){/* <!-- markdown-link-check-enable --> */}. Or if you prefer video tutorials to follow through, websites such as [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/figma-getting-started) and even [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6rQFP9zCAM) have tutorials for beginners.

## Guidelines

Brightlayer UI has design guidelines that serve as the foundation for the design system. These are intentional design choices we made to shape the Brightlayer UI brand — what Brightlayer UI applications should look like and how users should interact with them.

# General Guidance

Eaton hardware (such as power meters or a UPS) generate a lot of data, and we often convert that data into actionable insights. Eaton software should make energy management problems easier to solve, and communicate data insights efficiently.

Brightlayer UI is here to support designers in creating products that help our customers solve problems and add value to their energy management. These principles can help:

## Know your audience

Run user research with your team before committing to designs. We must fully understand user journeys first and ensure we capture entry points, pain points and user needs.

    images={[Audience, Feedback]}
    captionsUnderImages={[
        'Build and validate personas to make design decisions easier, while helping shape product strategy',
        'Early feedback from stakeholders and users will save you design and development time'
    ]}
/>

## Understand your content

It's important to conduct stakeholder workshops before designing interfaces, in order to understand the product you’ll be working on. Eaton projects have many sources of information, and as a designer you can help your team make sense of all that data. Once you have a good overview of the needs coming from both sides (business and users), Brightlayer UI can help you create apps and interfaces that address those needs.

    captionsUnderImages={[
        'Design Thinking workshops help define the problem, generate alternatives and reach consensus among team members',
        'Brightlayer UI components provide solutions to your most common design needs, including displaying and organising content'
    ]}

## Design with screen size in mind

Flexible interfaces generally adopt a mobile first mindset. If your personas will make use of mobile devices, that's what we recommend as well when working with the Brightlayer UI design system. It's much easier to scale designs up than to scale them down.

When working with a dedicated mobile app (iOS/Android), familiarize yourself with device / platform capabilities and take advantage of these where possible. As technology continues to evolve, it is important to consider scaling for the future. Products such as non-mobile touch screens, interactive displays, automotive displays, and touch screen laptops should be considered during your design phase.

## Apply industry best practices

Strive for consistency by using pre-defined Brightlayer UI elements where possible. By using these elements, your users can experience familiarity across different products and get things done faster. You can also help ensure consistency by defining patterns in language, layout and design that are used throughout the application.

Ensure that the application provides effective feedback to users. Make sure that you communicate location, actions, changes in state, and errors to users. Brightlayer UI has various UI elements to assist with communicating this information.

Consider using defaults. If you have a strong understanding of the users of your application, careful planning around default states, actions, and paths can reduce the burden on your users.

## Make it meaningful

To stay competitive in our current landscape, we must offer data insights that are truly helpful and make a measurable difference in our users’ lives, going beyond raw data logs. Our products need to not only display current and historical data, but create value from it.


<ImageGrid
    images={[Dashboard, Filterdata]}
    captionsUnderImages={[
        'A dashboard full of charts can look good, but it might not be helpful to the personas using your product',
        'Filtering data according to context (which you can understand through user research) contributes to a more purposeful product'

# Contributing

We encourage everyone to provide feedback, new design concepts, patterns, suggestions, or other ideas to help us create the most useful design system for our community. If you would like to contribute back, please [contact us](/community/contactus)!

In order to maintain the quality standards for Brightlayer UI resources, any submissions will be subject to review by the Brightlayer UI maintainers. If your design is made a part of Brightlayer UI, we'll add items onto our backlog to bring them to life in code for developers to use.
