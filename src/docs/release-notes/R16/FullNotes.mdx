import React from 'react';

### Component Libraries

-   Added new components to our [Angular](https://brightlayer-ui-components.github.io/angular) and [React Native](https://brightlayer-ui-components.github.io/react-native) component libraries:
    -   For Angular, we now have components for [Drawer](https://brightlayer-ui-components.github.io/angular/components/drawer/examples), [List Item Tag](https://brightlayer-ui-components.github.io/angular/components/list-item-tag/examples), [Spacer](https://brightlayer-ui-components.github.io/angular/components/spacer/examples), [Score card](https://brightlayer-ui-components.github.io/angular/components/score-card/examples), and [Info List Item](https://brightlayer-ui-components.github.io/angular/components/info-list-item/examples).
    -   For React Native, we now have a [Drawer](https://brightlayer-ui-components.github.io/react-native/?path=/info/components-documentation--drawer) component.
-   Enhanced style override capabilities on all of our React and React Native components
-   Adopted [React Native Paper](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/) as our official Material component library for React Native projects

### Reusable Workflows

We're excited to announce the availability of our first re-usable workflow: a reusable [Authentication Workflow](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/react-native-auth-workflow) for React Native apps. This workflow allows teams to use a common implementation for login & registration across different projects (just hook it up to your API).

### Design Patterns

-   Migrated React design patterns into a single repository.
-   Angular, React Native, and Ionic design patterns will be migrated in an upcoming release.

### PX Blue CLI

The first version of the [PX Blue CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/cli) is now available. This tool allows you to generate new Angular, Ionic, React, or React Native projects pre-loaded with PX Blue components and themes, with no manual configuration required.

### Miscellaneous

-   Added search capability to documentation site
-   [Sticker Sheet](https://www.figma.com/community/file/852558784352181868) published to the Figma Community
