### Dark Themes

We've added a dark theme for Angular and React applications. These are available starting in version 2.0.0 of our [@pxblue/themes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/themes) package.

### Hybrid Code Examples

We have begun building out mobile pattern examples, starting with [Login](/patterns/user-auth). You'll notice two new options in the framework selection dropdown for our supported mobile technologies.

### Design Patterns

New design patterns and examples are available for [Forms and Validation](/patterns/forms) and [Internationalization](/patterns/internationalization).

### Ionic Support

PX Blue now offers support for developing mobile applications with [Ionic](/development/frameworks-mobile/ionic). Ionic 4+ is capable of working with the Angular Material component library and PX Blue themes for Angular. We will be phasing out support for NativeScript applications in favor of Ionic.

### Component Library

Re-usable components built by the PX Blue team for use in your applications. We currently have **Hero** components available for both Angular (version 7) and [React](https://brightlayer-ui-components.github.io/react/components/hero).

### Miscellaneous

-   Bug fixes and theme improvements
-   New icons and updated [Iconography Page](/style/icon-library)
