**Important!**: this will be the final release for PX Blue. For our next release, we will be re-branding our platform as _Brightlayer UI_ (Brightlayer User Interface). More details will be coming soon 🤗

### Component Libraries

-   Updated Angular library to build with Angular 12.
-   Documented all the components with JSDocs, viewable with Intellisense.
-   Added new icon library for React Native projects and enhanced / simplified [icon usage options](https://brightlayer-ui-components.github.io/react-native/?path=/info/components-documentation--icons) within the React Native component library.
-   All PX Blue React Native components now respond properly to device rotation / orientation.

### Component Sticker Sheet

-   Updated Figma [Component Sticker Sheet](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1024360297793425107) to include 57 new device- and channel-related icons. You can also find all of them in our [iconography](/style/iconography) page.
-   All icons (Material Design and PX Blue icons) are now searchable by their aliases in Figma.
-   Added more system components, including: phone keyboard, phone keypad, status bar, browser window, cursor, system dialog box and time picker.

### Themes

-   Style tweaks for Angular chips, drawer, and inputs.
-   Enhanced showcase demos for [Angular](https://github.com/brightlayer-ui/angular-showcase-demo/tree/master) and [React](https://github.com/brightlayer-ui/react-showcase-demo) to display all PX Blue and Material components in an organized manner.
-   Simplified [Dark Theming for React Native](https://github.com/brightlayer-ui/react-native-themes/tree/master#dark-theme) (eliminated the need for alternate dark theme and provide special pre-themed wrappers for React Native Paper components).
