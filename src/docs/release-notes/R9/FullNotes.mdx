PX Blue has seen a lot of really great enhancements behind the scenes in this latest release.

### Updated Examples & StackBlitz

Previous component-level examples have been replaced by more comprehensive code samples that show how to build common UI elements (e.g., navigation, lists). You can see the following and more in the new Design Patterns section.

-   [Visualizations](/patterns/visualizations), including basic Highcharts and Mapbox support
-   [Login](/patterns/user-auth) and [Navigation](/patterns/navigation)
-   Lots and lots of [List](/patterns/lists) examples

And more will be coming soon. We plan to deliver additional examples on a regular basis (not just during major releases), so make sure to check back often.

We have also migrated all of our code samples to [StackBlitz](http://www.stackblitz.com/@px-blue) to allow for live code updating and easier dependency management. We encourage you to make use of this tool to share code and foster a community of inner-sourcing where possible.

### Going Open Source

PX Blue is officially going open source in version 2.2. All of our code samples are available on GitHub and we have also published a number of packages to NPM to make integrating PX Blue into your applications much simpler. This will also allow us to continuously deliver and version updates to PX Blue resources. See the updated Framework Guides to learn how to pull these packages into your applications. PX Blue is licensed under the BSD-3-Clause license agreement. The text of this license can be found in any of our [resource repositories](https://github.com/brightlayer-ui).

### More Hybrid Support

PX Blue now supports hybrid development in [Cordova](/development/frameworks-mobile/cordova) and [React Native](/development/frameworks-mobile/react-native), and we have provided additional information for those already using NativeScript.

### Style Updates

We've also made some minor update to our color palette and typography hierarchy to improve our alignment with corporate branding requests. We also have updated icons in our icon font. Make sure to upgrade to the latest versions to be up-to-date.
