### Mapbox Themes

Initial versions of Mapbox themes are now available, in both light (blue) and dark varieties. You can read more about using these themes in your application on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/mapbox).

### Highcharts Support Updates

Our Highcharts packages have been moved from **@pxblue/visualizations/highcharts** to **@pxblue/highcharts**. As part of the move, we have updated the package with chart building functions, so you can specify parts of the configuration you want to change (or use our PX Blue defaults). You can read more about using these functions on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/highcharts).

### Updated Code Examples

We've added a number of new design patterns & code examples:

-   Updated [Highcharts / Mapbox](/patterns/visualizations) demos
-   User Self-Registration flow added to [Login](/patterns/user-auth) example
-   Some new [App Bar](/patterns/appbar) patterns and examples

### Icons, Icons, Icons

We've expanded on our previous offering of a PX Blue icon font. We now have icons available as:

-   [Icon Font](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/icons): All icons packaged into a single font
-   [SVG Icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/icons-svg): icons available as standalone SVGs (including a sprite sheet to be used with Angular applications)
-   [Material-UI Icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/icons-mui): Material-UI style icon components for use in React applications
-   Progress Icons ([Angular](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/ng-progress-icons), [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/react-progress-icons)): Dynamic icons that can be variably filled for showing progress, health, etc.

We've also overhauled our [Iconography](/style/icon-library) page to include a demo of all of the PX Blue supplemental icons.
