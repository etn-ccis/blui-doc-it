import React from 'react';

## GitHub Enterprise Migration

-   Migrated our code base to a [GitHub Enterprise](https://github.com/etn-ccis?q=blui) to align with other Eaton platform teams.

## Documentation Site

-   Added style guidelines for designing [app store logos](/style/logo).
-   Added design guidelines for the [buttons](/patterns/buttons) design pattern.
-   Added guidelines for how to request, conduct and interpret a [UI design audit](/design/design-audit).
-   Added a page featuring a list of currently published [Brightlayer UI based projects](/community/blui-projects).

## Figma Component Sticker Sheet

-   Added new text field-based components, such as Physical Location Address Text Fields, Phone Number Text Fields, to the Figma component sticker sheet.
-   Added a new component, App Logo Template, to help designers design their product app store logos.
-   Added iPhone's "Dynamic Island" as a component.
-   Added a Breadcrumb component.

## Angular

-   Updated our packages to support Angular 14.

## Misc

-   Dropped support for Javascript — moving forward all of our packages, examples, and templates will exclusively use Typescript. The Brightlayer UI CLI will now only generate typescript projects.
-   Removed our packages' dependency on `@mui/styles`.
-   Bug fixes & minor updates.
