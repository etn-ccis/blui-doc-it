### Hybrid Apps

Hybrid app support. We now support NativeScript for iOS and Android app development using Angular, TypeScript and JavaScript. NativeScript allows you to use your existing web development skills to build native apps for iOS and Android that share a single common codebase. You can read more in our guide.

### Project Tool

The PX Blue 2.1 release also includes an early beta version of the PX Blue Project Tool.

You can read more in our Project Tool introduction.
