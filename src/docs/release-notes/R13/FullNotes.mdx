import React from 'react';

### Design Patterns

New design pattern and examples are available for [Loading](/patterns/loading) and [Empty States](/patterns/empty-states).

### Hybrid Code Examples

We have continued to build out our mobile pattern examples. Examples added in this release include [Loading](/patterns/loading) and [Empty States](/patterns/empty-states) and various [Lists](/patterns/lists) (Data List, Status List, Action List). More examples will be coming soon.

### Theme Demos

We now have examples showing how the different PX Blue [Themes](/style/themes) affect various UI elements in an application.

### StackBlitz Update

We are now running all of our embedded code examples directly from their respective GitHub repositories. This allows our examples to automatically stay up to date with all of the latest changes in source control. As a result, the standalone example repository on [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/@px-blue) will be going away. If you are accustomed to browsing our examples from there, have a look at our [Resources](/resources) page, which now has links to all of our examples. You can also see the [Code Sharing](/community/innersourcing) to learn more about the different tools we are using for hosting these examples.

### ChartJS

PX Blue now offers resources for working with ChartJS - an open source alternative to HighCharts. You can read more on our [Visualizations](/patterns/visualizations) page or on the [ChartJS](https://www.chartjs.org) documentation site.

### Component Library

We have been working to innersource new PX Blue components for React Native applications - these are currently available as [@pxblue/react-native-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/react-native-components). Documentation for these components can be found on GitHub. This package is still in alpha, but a production version will be made available in an upcoming PX Blue release.

### Miscellaneous

-   Bug fixes and improvements
-   Angular examples have all been updated to Angular 8
-   New [Icons](/style/icon-library)
