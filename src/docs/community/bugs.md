# Encountering and Reporting Bugs

One of the primary reasons for using Google's [Material Design](https://material.io/) system is to take advantage of the large community of development resources attached to the project. This improves the response time for issues and cuts down on the number of bugs in the platforms. But nobody is perfect - if you run into an issue, please let us know.
