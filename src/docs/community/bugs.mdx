# Encountering and Reporting Bugs

One of the primary reasons for using Google's [Material Design](https://m2.material.io/) system is to take advantage of the large community of development resources attached to the project. This improves the response time for issues and cuts down on the number of bugs in the platforms. But nobody is perfect - if you run into an issue, please let us know.

## If You Encounter a Bug w/ Brightlayer UI

If you run into a bug with:

-   Brightlayer UI themes, components, or other NPM packages
-   Brightlayer UI code samples or
-   the Brightlayer UI documentation on this site

you can help us make the experience better for yourself and others by reporting a bug. Simply [Contact us](/community/contactus) with the following information:

-   Summary: a brief, but clear description of the issue.
-   Description: more detailed information about the issue including steps to reproduce.
-   Environment: information about your machine (Operating System, Browser Version).

You can also report issues on the appropriate page on [GitHub](https://github.com/etn-ccis?q=blui).
