# Innersource into Brightlayer UI

One of the primary goals of Brightlayer UI is to eliminate the need for teams to duplicate effort. If you have built something using Brightlayer UI that you think would benefit other development teams, we would love to hear from you. Please click the button below and fill out the form to submit your new ideas.

<NewFeatureFormButton title={'Submit Your Idea'} />

Alternatively, you may [send us an email](/community/contactus).

## Submitting Code Directly

Developers can also choose to add a feature by creating a pull request on our [GitHub](https://github.com/etn-ccis?q=blui). Please check out our [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/etn-ccis/blui-doc-it/blob/master/src/docs/community/contributing-guideline.md) before you get started.

We build our code examples using GitHub and use several online tools, such as [Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io) and [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/) for sharing them. These tools allow you to import GitHub repositories and make the code runnable and editable in an online IDE. If you have not used these tools before, they're a great way to play with code and make sharing code snippets much easier. We recommend that you try them out when submitting code samples to speed up the process.

## How We Innersource New Features

After we hear from you about an innersourcing opportunity, our first step is to evaluate the proposed idea. How common is this practice? How many Eaton applications use it? How many will use it in the future? Is this a low-hanging fruit or does it require significant effort? Once we reach a conclusion, we will get in touch with you about next steps.

If we move forward with the innersourcing effort, the next step is to perform a detailed audit (both design and development where appropriate) to evaluate conformity with Brightlayer UI. We will evaluate your usage of colors, components, and layouts to ensure that the proposed idea aligns with our existing patterns and we will also evaluate the overall re-usability of what you have created. During this process, we may contact you from time to time to ask questions or discuss parts of your submission.

In most cases, submissions will require some amount of iteration or updates before they will be brought into the Brightlayer UI design system. These updates can be performed by you or the Brightlayer UI team depending on availability and timeframe. We will work with you to establish a plan for releasing the new materials and add it to one of our scheduled quarterly releases (see our [roadmap](/roadmap) for details). Depending on the nature of the materials, they will be added to our Figma library (designs), NPM packages, and/or design pattern code examples. Occasionally, code may be available for testing in the form of alpha or beta packages prior to its official release.
