# New Project Guide
When approaching a potential new project, it can be challenging to know where to start. As a first step, it's helpful to decide if this is going to be a web application, mobile application, or both? Here is a run-down of these different types of applications.

### Web Applications
These applications are accessible over the web. They can be accessed from any device with a network connection and a web browser (personal computer, mobile phone). To learn more about what a web application entails, check out our [Web App](/get-started/web) guide.

### Mobile Applications
Mobile applications are intended to be used strictly on mobile devices (e.g., cell phones, tablets, etc.). These can be downloaded directly to the device (e.g., from the App Store or Google Play) and do not have to be connected to the internet to run. To learn more about what a mobile application entails, including the difference between native and hybrid apps, check out our [Mobile App](/get-started/mobile) guide.


## Deciding What Kind of Application to Build
With a new project, deciding which type of application you need is influenced by the type of project.

### This Project is Replacing an Existing Product
Think about the existing product and how it is used. Gather feedback from existing users and identify areas for improvement.

In general, you will want to at least provide the same type of application as before (unless user feedback suggests that it's not what they need). If you had a web application before, you may want to build a responsive web application this time. Alternatively,  you may want to expand on the existing product by offering a mobile application. 

### This is a Brand New Product (never before seen)
Think about how the product will be used. Does it offer features that users will want to access on the go? Is it going to be actively used in the field, or is it something users will more likely use from their desk?

In general, you can't go wrong with a web application. If you do your due diligence and design a properly responsive application, you will be able to access it from any connected device, including mobile. If you suspect that the primary mode of interacting with the application will be from a mobile device or if the application needs to work offline, you may want to consider building a dedicated mobile app.
