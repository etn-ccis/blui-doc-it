# Web Applications
Web applications are everywhere. As the name suggests, they can be accessed from any device that can access the Internet. This means they have a lot of flexibility, but that comes with extra responsibility when designing them.

## Responsive Design
Responsive web design is critical for web applications today. With a nearly infinite variety of web-capable devices available, you'll want your application to look great on all of them. It's much easier to design a responsive web application if you start with mobile designs first. If you can fit your features into a mobile-sized display, it's much easier to scale up to a desktop size than it is to design for desktop and then scale everything down to mobile.


## Get Started With a Web App
There are a lot of wonderful web applications out there and tons of options for how to proceed. Most modern applications are built with HTML/CSS and sit inside a JavaScript framework. If your application needs to be very small, or if you don't really have a need for a JavaScript infrastructure, you can certainly build static applications with just HTML and CSS. You can also use "vanilla" JavaScript without the need for including an entire JavaScript framework in your application. We support both Angular and React in the PX Blue design system.

For a comparison of the pros/cons of each of these frameworks, see our [Framework Introduction](/development/frameworks-web/intro).

One of the goals of PX Blue is to maximize maintainability and code re-use by standardizing on certain technologies. If you want to use a different framework from those that we support, you'll need to consider these trade-offs.
