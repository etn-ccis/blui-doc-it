As a first step, it's helpful to decide if this is going to be a web application, mobile application, or both. Here is a run-down of these different types of applications.\n\n## Web Applications\n\nThese applications are accessible over the web. They can be accessed from any device with a network connection and a web browser (personal computer, mobile phone). To learn more about what a web application entails, check out our [Web App](/get-started/web) guide.\n\n## Mobile Applications\n\nMobile applications are intended to be used strictly on mobile devices (e.g., cell phones, tablets, etc.). These can be downloaded directly to the device (e.g., from the App Store or Google Play) and do not have to be connected to the Internet to run. To learn more about what a mobile application entails, including the difference between native and hybrid apps, check out our [Mobile App](/get-started/mobile) guide.\n\n<Divider />\n\n# Deciding What Kind of Application to Build\n\nWith a new project, the nature of the project often determines which type of application you will need.\n\n## This Project is Replacing an Existing Product\n\nThink about the existing product and how it is used. Gather feedback from existing users and identify areas for improvement.\n\nIn general, you will want to at least provide the same type of application as before (unless user feedback suggests that it's not what they need). If you had a web application before, you may want to build a responsive web application this time. Alternatively, you may want to expand on the existing product by offering a mobile application.\n\n## This is a Brand New Product (never before seen)\n\nThink about how the product will be used. Does it offer features that users will want to access on the go? Is it going to be actively used in the field, or is it something users will more likely use from their desk?\n\nIn general, you can't go wrong with a web application. If you do your due diligence and design a properly responsive application, you will be able to access it from any connected device, including mobile. If you suspect that the primary mode of interacting with the application will be from a mobile device or if the application needs to work offline, you may want to consider building a dedicated mobile app.\n"

        "text": "<!-- KEYWORDS: web application introduction framework -->\n\n# Web Applications\n\nWeb applications are everywhere. As the name suggests, they can be accessed from any device that can access the Internet. This means they have a lot of flexibility, but that comes with extra responsibility when you design them.\n\n## Responsive Design\n\nResponsive web design is critical for web applications today. With a nearly infinite variety of web-capable devices available, you'll want your application to look great on all of them. It's much easier to design a responsive web application if you start with mobile designs first. If you can fit your features into a mobile-sized display, it's much easier to scale up to a desktop size than it is to design for desktop and then scale everything down to mobile.\n\n## Get Started With a Web App\n\nThere are a lot of wonderful web applications out there and tons of options for how to proceed. Most modern applications are built with HTML / CSS and sit inside a JavaScript framework. If your application needs to be very small, or if you don't really have a need for a JavaScript infrastructure, you can certainly build static applications with just HTML and CSS. You can also use \"vanilla\" JavaScript without the need for including an entire JavaScript framework in your application. We support both Angular and React in the Brightlayer UI design system.\n\nFor a comparison of the pros / cons of each of these frameworks, see our [Framework Introduction](/development/frameworks-web/intro).\n\nOne of the goals of Brightlayer UI is to maximize maintainability and code re-use by standardizing on certain technologies. If you want to use a different framework from those that we support, you'll need to consider the trade-offs.\n"

        "title": "Mobile Apps",
        "text": "import { Divider } from '../../app/components';\n\n<!-- KEYWORDS: mobile hybrid compare comparison native application -->\n\n# Mobile Applications\n\nMobile applications are very popular. They can be accessed anywhere you can take your mobile device, both online and offline, and can take greater advantage of device features and capabilities than a web application.\n\nMobile applications come in two primary varieties: native apps and hybrid apps.\n\n## Native mobile apps\n\n-   Must be built using the native code that runs on mobile devices. In general, that means Java (Android) or Swift / Objective C (iOS)\n-   Should adhere to the design and development guidelines for the intended platforms:\n    -   [iOS Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/overview/themes/)\n        <!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->\n    -   [Android Guidelines](https://developer.android.com/design/index.html)\n        <!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->\n\nAndroid and iOS are the dominant players in the mobile market, but you should check with your particular users to see what is most prevalent in your target market.\n\n## Hybrid mobile apps\n\n-   Maintained as a single code base that is deployed to multiple different device types (namely iOS and Android)\n-   Built using web-technologies (i.e. JavaScript)\n    -   low barrier to entry for web developers\n-   Implemented differently depending on the framework:\n    -   some compile down to native components\n    -   others render all content in a web view (essentially a web page running inside of an app)\n\n<Divider style={{}} />\n\n# Comparing the two approaches\n\n## Native mobile apps\n\n-   Guaranteed to look & feel like an app since it uses native components\n-   Requires more specialized development expertise\n-   Requires separate code bases for different operating systems\n    -   Longer development time\n    -   More expensive / more maintenance\n\n## Hybrid mobile apps\n\n-   Reduces development time thanks to shared code base\n-   Provides more technology options\n    -   Many different hybrid platforms / tools available\n-   Allows for a consistent look on different platforms\n-   Makes development easier by using web technologies, but it's also easier to make something that doesn't follow standard mobile patterns\n\n<Divider style={{}} />\n\n# So, which one should you use?\n\nOur recommendation for mobile applications is to take a hybrid approach. This will allow you to deploy multiple versions of your application (i.e. iOS and Android) from a single code base. We offer support for several different approaches to building hybrid apps (see our [Mobile Framework Introduction](/development/frameworks-mobile/intro) to learn about the technologies we support).\n\nIf you prefer to build a strictly native app and adhere to the Brightlayer UI standards, there are ways of doing this using [Material Design Components for Android](https://material.io/develop/android/) and [Material Design Components for iOS](https://material.io/develop/ios/).\n\n> **NOTE:** Brightlayer UI support for native mobile applications is limited - if you are planning to go this route, please [Contact us](/community/contactus).\n"

    "/development/environment": {
        "title": "Environment Setup",
        "text": "import { Divider } from '../../app/components';\n\n<!-- KEYWORDS: developer develop environment guide tutorial -->\n\n# Setting up Your Development Environment\n\nGetting started is often the most frustrating part of application development. Fortunately, many of the modern JavaScript frameworks have made great strides in providing tools to get you up and running as quickly as possible. Below, we walk through the basics of getting your system set up to develop.\n\n## Integrated Development Environment (IDE)\n\nThere are a bunch of different IDEs on the market, and in general you should be able to use any of these that you like and are comfortable with. If you don't have a personal preference, we recommend trying [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) - it is quite excellent and comes with a variety of tools to make your development experience seamless. And it's free!\n\n## Git\n\nChances are, you probably want to keep your application in source control. Git is one of the big players in this space (it's also the backbone for BitBucket).\n\nYou may already have git installed. To check, run:\n\n```sh\ngit --version\n```\n\nin a command prompt. If you don't have git installed, you can download it from the [Git Website](http://git-scm.com/downloads).\n\nIf you are behind a proxy, you'll also need to set up the git proxies as well:\n\n```sh\ngit config --global http.proxy http://url.to.your.proxy:port\ngit config --global https.proxy http://url.to.your.proxy:port\n```\n\nThe proxy addresses may vary depending on your location. Consult your local IT department if you’re not sure.\n\n## Node\n\nThe majority of JavaScript frameworks (and Brightlayer UI resources) are available via the Node Package Manager (NPM). This package manager allows you to install a variety of third party tools, packages, and other dependencies that you need for your applications. To use NPM, you will need to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).\n\n## Yarn\n\nOur projects and example code are set up to be run using yarn, but if you prefer, you're welcome to use NPM in your projects instead. Instructions for installing yarn on various operating systems can be found on the [Yarn Website](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).\n\nTo check if you have yarn installed, run:\n\n```sh\nyarn -v\n```\n\nfrom a command prompt. If you are behind a proxy, you will also need to configure your proxy settings. It may be sufficient for you to set `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` in your environment variables. However, you may need to also explicitly set proxy values for yarn:\n\n```sh\nyarn config set proxy http://url.to.your.proxy:port\nyarn config set https-proxy http://url.to.your.proxy:port\n```\n\nThe proxy addresses may vary depending on your location. Consult your local IT department if you’re not sure. Once you have configured the proxy, you should be able to install packages by using:\n\n```sh\nyarn add <package-name>\n```\n\n> If you are installing packages globally using yarn, you will need to ensure that your PATH variable has an entry pointing to your global yarn install directory. This location will vary based on your operating system.\n\n<Divider />\n\n# Hybrid App Development\n\nIf you are setting up for building a mobile app, there are some additional steps you will want to take to prepare. The following requirements are the basics. Depending on your selected [framework](/development/frameworks-mobile/intro), there will be other specific setup steps detailed in our Getting Started Guides.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n### Hardware\n\nMobile development is resource-intensive, so you will need a development machine that is up to the task. Your machine should at least match the following minimum requirements:\n\n-   a Mac (if you plan on building or testing iOS locally)\n-   16GB RAM or more (running multiple emulators can easily push you over 20GB)\n-   Solid State Hard Drive (SSD)\n-   5/6 Gen Core i7 with Virtualization Technology or better\n\n### Software\n\nThere are a few software tools that you will need before you can get started:\n\n<!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->\n\n-   [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) (required for building for Android)\n    <!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->\n-   [xCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (Mac-only, required for building for iOS)\n"

Both are open source JavaScript frameworks with large communities of support and both have open source component libraries implementing Material Design. The two are quite comparable and you would not go wrong by choosing either, but there are some notable differences outlined below.\n\n## Angular (with Angular Material)\n\n-   A comprehensive framework, with a lot of built-in features and functionality\n-   Written in TypeScript (superset of JavaScript with strong variable typing)\n-   Structured way of organizing your entire application (if following the Angular CLI)\n-   May be more accessible to developers with greater back-end or full-stack experience\n-   Maintained by Google\n-   Learn more on the [Angular website](https://angular.io/)\n\n## React (with Material UI)\n\n-   A UI library for building custom Web Components / Applications\n-   Can be combined with additional libraries (e.g. Redux) to be a more comprehensive framework\n-   Virtual DOM allows for fewer re-renders (i.e., faster UI updates)\n-   May be more accessible to developers with greater experience with JavaScript and front-end development\n-   Maintained by Facebook\n-   Learn more on the [React website](https://reactjs.org/)\n\n<Divider style={{}} />\n\n# Which framework should I use?\n\nChoosing a framework is entirely up to you. They each have their own pros and cons, so you'll need to decide what is best for your application. In general, if you have developers who are very familiar with a particular framework, it might be worthwhile to use that framework to avoid any unnecessary learning curves associated with a new one. If you don't have development resources yet, you will probably want to conduct a more in-depth analysis of the available frameworks to decide what is most appropriate for your application. Feel free to reach out to us for assistance if needed.\n\nIf you choose to use one of these frameworks, have a look at our Guides for using them with Brightlayer UI:\n\n-   [Angular Guide](/development/frameworks-web/angular)\n-   [React Guide](/development/frameworks-web/react)\n"

Alternatively, you can also start your project by downloading one of our code samples from [Github](https://github.com/brightlayer-ui) (the Login or Navigation examples are good projects to start from).\n\n## Using the Brightlayer UI CLI\n\nThe fastest way to start a new Brightlayer UI project is to use the [Brightlayer UI CLI](/development/cli). The CLI will automatically create a starter project for you (using the [Angular CLI](http://cli.angular.io/)) with all of the necessary Brightlayer UI dependencies pre-configured. To start an Angular project:\n\n```sh\nnpx -p @brightlayer-ui/cli blui new angular\n```\n\nYou will be asked to provide a name for your project and whether or not you want to use the Brightlayer UI eslint and prettier configurations files.\n\nThe Brightlayer UI CLI will automatically include:\n\n-   Angular Material Component Library ([@angular/material](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/material))\n-   Brightlayer UI Component Library ([@brightlayer-ui/angular-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/angular-components))\n-   Brightlayer UI Themes ([@brightlayer-ui/angular-themes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/angular-themes))\n-   Brightlayer UI Icons ([@brightlayer-ui/icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/icons))\n-   Brightlayer UI Colors ([@brightlayer-ui/colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/colors))\n-   Open Sans web font ([@font-source/open-sans](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fontsource/open-sans))\n-   Brightlayer UI ESLint and Prettier configurations, if selected ([@brightlayer-ui/eslint-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/eslint-config) / [@brightlayer-ui/prettier-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/prettier-config))\n\nFor detailed usage instructions, refer to the [Brightlayer UI CLI documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/cli).\n\n## Using an Existing Project\n\nIf you have an existing project and would like to integrate Brightlayer UI, you can follow the manual integration instructions below. If you have not already started your project, we recommend that you scaffold your project with the Brightlayer UI CLI.\n\n<Divider />\n\n# Manual Brightlayer UI Integration\n\nBefore taking the following steps, you'll want to make sure that you have an existing application. If you used the Brightlayer UI CLI to start your project, these steps have already been done for you automatically.\n\n## Including the Component Libraries\n\n### Angular Material\n\nAngular projects should make use of the [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) component library. Our Brightlayer UI themes are designed to work with these components.\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save @angular/material\n// or\nyarn add @angular/material\n```\n\nFor detailed documentation about the various components available in Angular Material, as well as sample code and API reference, refer to the [Angular Material Documentation](https://material.angular.io/components/).\n\n### Brightlayer UI Components\n\nAdditionally, we have a [supplemental library](https://github.com/brightlayer-ui/angular-component-library/tree/dev) of components designed specifically for Brightlayer UI applications. If you wish to use these components, you can install them by running:\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save @brightlayer-ui/angular-components\n// or\nyarn add @brightlayer-ui/angular-components\n```\n\n## Adding Brightlayer UI Themes\n\nBy default, your application will be themed with the Google Material theme. To use the [Brightlayer UI theme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/angular-themes), first install it:\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save @brightlayer-ui/angular-themes\n// or\nyarn add @brightlayer-ui/angular-themes\n```\n\nInstalling the theme package will automatically include the Open Sans web font package as well as the Brightlayer UI [colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/colors) package. In order to use the Brightlayer UI themes and font (Open Sans), you will need to modify your angular.json file \"styles\" entries (there is one under \"build\" and one under \"test\") to include the Brightlayer UI themes and Open Sans reference:\n\n```json\n\"styles\": [\n    \"src/styles.scss\",\n    \"./node_modules/@brightlayer-ui/angular-themes/theme.scss\",\n    \"./node_modules/@brightlayer-ui/angular-themes/open-sans.scss\",\n],\n```\n\n### Applying the Theme\n\nYou can apply the theme to your application by adding the proper class to your application's body element:\n\n```html\n// Default Theme\n<body class=\"blui-blue\" />\n\n// Dark Theme\n<body class=\"blui-blue-dark\" />\n```\n\n> If you do not specify a theme class, your application will use the default Material theme.\n\nYou can access the fonts using mat-typography, e.g.:\n\n```html\n<section class=\"mat-typography>\n   <h1>H1 Text</h1>\n   <h2>H2 Text</h2>\n   <p>Paragraph text</p>\n   <div class=\"body-2\">Bold body copy</div>\n</section>\n```\n\nYou can access theme colors as well, e.g.:\n\n```html\n<mat-toolbar color=\"primary\">My App</mat-toolbar>\n```\n\nMore details about applying themes in your application can be found in [Theming your Angular Material app](https://material.angular.io/guide/theming).\n\n<Divider />\n\n# Additional Information\n\n## Code Formatting / Style\n\nPX Blue provides packages for code standards and style using ESLint and Prettier. These packages are used internally by the Brightlayer UI team, but they can also be used in your projects. You can find instructions for adding these packages to your project on [GitHub](https://github.com/brightlayer-ui/code-standards).\n\n## Browser Support\n\nPX Blue supports the same browsers as Angular and Angular Material. For specifics, please check out their support pages:\n\n-   [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/guide/browser-support)\n-   [Angular Material](https://github.com/angular/material2#browser-and-screen-reader-support)\n\n> With the end-of-life of Internet Explorer 11, Brightlayer UI will no longer be supporting IE11 as of 2021.\n\n## License Information\n\n[Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/LICENSE) and [Angular Material](https://github.com/angular/material2/blob/master/LICENSE) are both available under the MIT License.\n"

To use the [Brightlayer UI theme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/react-themes), first install it:\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save @brightlayer-ui/react-themes\n// or\nyarn add @brightlayer-ui/react-themes\n```\n\nInstalling the theme package will automatically include the Open Sans web font package as well as the Brightlayer UI [colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/colors) package.\n\n### Applying the Theme\n\nImport the theme files, Material UI theme provider, and **Open Sans** font into your application, e.g. in App.js:\n\n```tsx\nimport { ThemeProvider, createMuiTheme } from '@material-ui/core/styles';\nimport CssBaseline from '@material-ui/core/CssBaseline';\nimport * as PXBThemes from '@brightlayer-ui/react-themes';\nimport '@brightlayer-ui/react-themes/open-sans';\n```\n\nTo add the theme to your whole application, you would simply add a `<ThemeProvider>` around your top-level component and pass it the theme you want to use, e.g.:\n\n```tsx\n<ThemeProvider theme={createMuiTheme(PXBThemes.blue)}>\n    <CssBaseline/>\n    <MyApp/>\n</MuiThemeProvider>\n```\n\nYou can read about [React Theming](https://mui.com/customization/theming/) to learn more.\n\n<Divider />\n\n# Additional Information\n\n## Code Formatting / Style\n\nPX Blue provides packages for code standards and style using ESLint and Prettier. These packages are used internally by the Brightlayer UI team, but they can also be used in your projects. You can find instructions for adding these packages to your project on [GitHub](https://github.com/brightlayer-ui/code-standards).\n\n> NOTE: the ESLint package is only available for TypeScript projects.\n\n## Browser Support\n\nPX Blue supports the same browsers as React and Material UI. For specifics, please check out their support pages:\n\n-   [React](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/supported-browsers-features)\n-   [Material UI](https://mui.com/getting-started/supported-platforms/)\n\n> With the end-of-life of Internet Explorer 11, Brightlayer UI will no longer be supporting IE11 as of 2021.\n\n## License Information\n\n[React](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/LICENSE) and [Material UI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/blob/master/LICENSE) are both available under the MIT License.\n"

Both are capable frameworks, but there are some significant differences between them, outlined below.\n\n## Ionic\n\n-   Built with web technology (framework agnostic)\n    -   Brightlayer UI only supports Ionic with Angular\n-   Runs in a WebView\n-   Is the fastest way to have a mobile app (if you already have a web app)\n-   Requires your web app to be optimized for mobile\n-   Has lots of available plugins to access hardware / native functionality\n-   Learn more on the [Ionic Website](https://ionicframework.com/)\n\n## React Native\n\n-   Renders native UI elements (not a WebView)\n-   Can re-use application logic code (React)\n-   Requires writing new code for UI (learning curve)\n-   Does not use CSS for styling (learning curve)\n-   Provides access to hardware functionality through various plugins / libraries\n-   Has a large community of support\n-   Learn more on the [React Native Website](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)\n\n<Divider style={{}} />\n\n# Which framework should I use?\n\nThis is entirely up to you. If time is your biggest concern, Ionic may be the best approach since it simply wraps an existing application and requires no additional code.\n\nHowever, if you want more control over the look and performance of your application, it may be better to use React Native. If you have a React application, you'd be able to re-use most of your application logic, but you have to write custom / dedicated UI views for mobile.\n\nIn general, if your development team is more familiar with Angular, we recommended using Ionic. If your team is more familiar with React, you won't go wrong by choosing React Native.\n\n<Divider style={{}} />\n\n# Building your application\n\nFollow the guidelines for app development using your chosen framework:\n\n-   [Ionic](/development/frameworks-mobile/ionic)\n    <!-- -   [Apache Cordova](/development/frameworks-mobile/cordova) -->\n-   [React Native](/development/frameworks-mobile/react-native)\n\nThese guides will walk you through the process of developing your application and ultimately creating a final binary to distribute (either to your testers or your final customers).\n\n## Deploying your application\n\nOnce you have built your application into a distributable binary, there are two options for distributing it.\n\n### Visual Studio App Center (formerly HockeyApp)\n\nVisual Studio App Center gives you a way to test your app with users before you are ready for final distribution. This service allows you to upload app binaries and create lists of people with whom to share them. These people will be notified via email when new versions of the app are available, and they will be prompted to download and install them directly onto their device. You will need to request access to Visual Studio App Center from IT.\n\n### App Store / Play Store\n\nFor final distribution of your application, you will need to utilize App Store Connect and / or Google Play Console.\n"

Alternatively, you can start your project by downloading one of our code samples from [Github](https://github.com/brightlayer-ui) (the Login example is a good project to start from) once you configure your environment.\n\n<Divider />\n\n# Setting Up Your Environment\n\nYou'll need to start by following the general instructions for setting up your development environment for mobile, found in our [Environment Guide](/development/environment). Since Ionic takes advantage of web technologies, you won't need any specific additional tools beyond what you would use for web development.\n\nIonic uses Cordova behind the scenes but offers some additional convenience tools on top. If you would prefer to write a pure Cordova application, you can read instructions in the [Apache Cordova Getting Started Guide](/development/frameworks-mobile/cordova).\n\n## Installing Ionic\n\nThe most up-to-date instructions for setting up Ionic can be found on the [Ionic Website](https://ionicframework.com/docs/installation/cli).\n\nTo get started, run:\n\n```sh\nnpm install -g @ionic/cli cordova\n// or\nyarn global add @ionic/cli cordova\n```\n\nYou'll also want to install some additional dependencies:\n\n```sh\nnpm install -g native-run gradle cordova-res\n// or\nyarn global add native-run gradle cordova-res\n```\n\nMake sure that you have a `GRADLE_HOME` entry in your PATH variable pointing to your gradle binary directory.\n\n<Divider />\n\n# Creating Your Application\n\n## Using the Brightlayer UI CLI\n\nThe fastest way to start a new Brightlayer UI project is to use the [Brightlayer UI CLI](/development/cli). The CLI will automatically create a starter project for you (using either the [Ionic CLI](https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli)) with all of the necessary Brightlayer UI dependencies pre-configured. To start an Ionic project:\n\n```sh\nnpx -p @brightlayer-ui/cli blui new ionic\n```\n\nYou will be asked to provide a name for your project and whether or not you want to use the Brightlayer UI eslint and prettier configurations files.\n\nThe Brightlayer UI CLI will automatically include:\n\n-   Angular Material Component Library ([@angular/material](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/material))\n-   Brightlayer UI Component Library ([@brightlayer-ui/angular-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/angular-components))\n-   Brightlayer UI Themes ([@brightlayer-ui/angular-themes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/angular-themes))\n-   Brightlayer UI Icons ([@brightlayer-ui/icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/icons))\n-   Brightlayer UI Colors ([@brightlayer-ui/colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/colors))\n-   Brightlayer UI ESLint and Prettier configurations, if selected ([@brightlayer-ui/eslint-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/eslint-config) / [@brightlayer-ui/prettier-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/prettier-config))\n\nFor detailed usage instructions, refer to the [Brightlayer UI CLI documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/cli).\n\n## Using an Existing Project\n\nIf you have an existing project and would like to integrate Brightlayer UI, you can follow the manual integration instructions below. If you have not already started your project, we recommend that you scaffold your project with the Brightlayer UI CLI.\n\n<Divider />\n\n# Manual Brightlayer UI Integration\n\nPlease refer to the Manual Brightlayer UI Integration steps for [Angular](/development/frameworks-web/angular).\n\n<Divider />\n\n# Writing an Ionic Application\n\nDeveloping an Ionic project with Angular is virtually identical to writing a normal web application using Angular.\n\n## Running your application\n\n`ionic serve` will run the application in a web browser on localhost:8100. In order to see the application run on a mobile device, you will need to add platforms.\n\n```sh\nionic cordova platform add android\nionic cordova platform add ios\n```\n\n> **NOTE**: You will only be able to add the ios platform if you are developing on a Mac.\n\nWhen the ionic cordova platform add completes, your project will have all the required native plugins installed along with several configuration files specific to your project.\n\n## Building your application\n\nThe project is now ready to build and you can run:\n\n```sh\nionic cordova build android\nionic cordova build ios\n```\n\nOnce complete, you can run your project in a device simulator (or connected device) by running:\n\n```sh\nionic cordova run android\nionic cordova run ios\n```\n\n<Divider />\n\n# Additional Information\n\n## Code Formatting / Style\n\nPX Blue provides packages for code standards and style using ESLint and Prettier. These packages are used internally by the Brightlayer UI team, but they can also be used in your projects. You can find instructions for adding these packages to your project on [GitHub](https://github.com/brightlayer-ui/code-standards).\n\n> **NOTE**: Depending on your version of Xcode, you may need to specify additional build flags to run on ios: `ionic cordova run ios --buildFlag=\"-UseModernBuildSystem=0\"`.\n\n## License Information\n\n[Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro#license) is available under the MIT License.\n"

In addition to the base requirements, you may also want the following:\n\n-   [Expo Client](https://expo.io/learn) (project creation / setup tool for React Native apps)(optional, for Expo projects)\n\n<Divider />\n\n# Creating Your Application\n\n## Using the Brightlayer UI CLI\n\nThe fastest way to start a new Brightlayer UI project is to use the [Brightlayer UI CLI](/development/cli). The CLI will automatically create a starter project for you (using either the [React Native Community CLI](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli) (recommended) or [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.io/)) with all of the necessary Brightlayer UI dependencies pre-configured. To start a React Native project:\n\n```sh\nnpx -p @brightlayer-ui/cli blui new react-native\n```\n\nYou will be asked to provide a name for your project, select a CLI to use, choose whether you would like to use TypeScript or JavaScript, and for TypeScript projects, you'll be asked if you want to use the Brightlayer UI eslint and prettier configurations files.\n\nThe Brightlayer UI CLI will automatically include:\n\n-   React Native Paper Component Library ([react-native-paper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-paper))\n-   Brightlayer UI Component Library ([@brightlayer-ui/react-native-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/react-native-components))\n-   Brightlayer UI Themes ([@brightlayer-ui/react-native-themes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/react-native-themes))\n-   Material Icons ([react-native-vector-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-vector-icons))\n-   Brightlayer UI Icons ([@brightlayer-ui/icons-svg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/icons-svg))\n-   Brightlayer UI Colors ([@brightlayer-ui/colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/colors))\n-   Open Sans font\n-   Brightlayer UI ESLint and Prettier configurations, if selected ([@brightlayer-ui/eslint-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/eslint-config) / [@brightlayer-ui/prettier-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/prettier-config))\n-   Testing libraries ([jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) / [react-test-renderer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-test-renderer))\n\nFor detailed usage instructions, refer to the [Brightlayer UI CLI documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/cli).\n\n## Using an Existing Project\n\nIf you have an existing project and would like to integrate Brightlayer UI, you can follow the manual integration instructions below. If you have not already started your project, we recommend that you scaffold your project with the Brightlayer UI CLI.\n\n<Divider />\n\n# Manual Brightlayer UI Integration\n\nBefore taking the following steps, you'll want to make sure that you have an existing application. If you used the Brightlayer UI CLI to start your project, these steps have already been done for you automatically.\n\n## Including the Component Libraries\n\n### Material Components\n\nReact Native projects should make use of the [React-Native-Paper](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/index.html) component library. Our Brightlayer UI themes are designed to work with these components. You'll also want to install [react-native-vector-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-vector-icons) to access the Material icons.\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save react-native-paper react-native-vector-icons\n// or\nyarn add react-native-paper react-native-vector-icons\n```\n\n### Brightlayer UI Components\n\nWe have a [supplemental library](https://github.com/brightlayer-ui/react-native-component-library/tree/dev) of components designed specifically for Brightlayer UI applications. If you wish to use these components, you can install them by running:\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save @brightlayer-ui/react-components\n// or\nyarn add @brightlayer-ui/react-native-components\n```\n\n## Adding Brightlayer UI Themes\n\nIf you are using the recommended component libraries, your application will be themed with the Google Material theme by default. To use the Brightlayer UI theme, first install it:\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save @brightlayer-ui/react-native-themes\n// or\nyarn add @brightlayer-ui/react-native-themes\n```\n\n> Using the Brightlayer UI React Native theme **requires** that you add the Open Sans font to your application. You can learn how to do this by reading the instructions for [Vanilla React Native](https://medium.com/react-native-training/react-native-custom-fonts-ccc9aacf9e5e) or [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/guides/using-custom-fonts/). You can find the fonts [here](https://github.com/brightlayer-ui/cli-helpers/tree/master/fonts).\n\n> When using Expo, you will need to specify the name for each font weight you load using the format OpenSans-`<Weight>`, e.g., OpenSans-SemiBold. Refer to one of our React Native demos for reference.\n\n## Applying the Theme\n\nImport the theme files and React Native Paper theme provider into your application, e.g. in App.js:\n\n```tsx\nimport { Provider as ThemeProvider } from 'react-native-paper';\nimport * as PXBThemes from '@brightlayer-ui/react-native-themes';\n...\n<ThemeProvider theme={PXBThemes.blue}>\n    <App />\n</ThemeProvider>\n```\n\nFor detailed information about theming, refer to the react-native-paper [theming guide](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/theming.html).\n\n> NOTE: This theme only applies to the components in the react-native-paper and @brightlayer-ui/react-native-components package. It will not theme the components from other third party libraries. If you wish to use our theme to style your own components, refer to the react-native-paper [theming guide](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/theming.html#using-the-theme-in-your-own-components).\n\n### Avoiding Repeated Styles\n\nTo avoid adding repeatedly adding inline styles to standard components, you can define your own component that applies the styles and use that throughout your application, e.g.:\n\n```tsx\n// MyText.js\nexport default MyText = ({style, children, ...other}) => (\n    <Text {...other} style={StyleSheet.flatten([{/* Theme styles here */}, style])}>\n        {children}\n    </Text>\n);\n\n// OtherFile.js\nimport Text from 'path/to/MyText.js';\n...\n<Text>Themed Text Object</Text>\n```\n\n<Divider />\n\n# Writing a React Native Application\n\nIf you are familiar with React development, React Native will be relatively simple to understand. The application logic remains the same, while the UI requires a little adjustment. Rather than typical HTML elements, React Native UIs are built with a special library of [Components](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/components-and-apis), including `<View>`, `<Text>`, `<Image>`, etc. React Native layouts are built exclusively using FlexBox.\n\n## Running your application\n\nAfter you've created your application with a CLI, it can be run from the command line:\n\n```sh\ncd YourAppName\n\n// RNC CLI\nnpm run <ios|android>\n// or\nyarn <ios|android>\n\n// Expo CLI (follow the on-screen instructions or use the web interface to open the app on a device)\nnpm run start\n// or\nyarn start\n```\n\nWhen you make changes to the source code, the application will automatically rebuild and update on the device.\n\n> To run on an Android emulator, the emulator must already be running or you will see an error message, \"No connected devices found.\"\n\n> On a Mac, you may be prompted to install watchman (`brew install watchman`) or update a few settings to run the application.\n\n## Ejecting from Expo\n\nIf you use Expo to create your project, there will come a time in your development when it becomes necessary to eject from Expo. The most common reason for this are for adding native libraries to your project.\n\nTo eject your app, run the following and follow the on-screen prompts (WARNING: Ejecting from Expo cannot be undone. Make sure you know what you are doing and have your project in source control before proceeding):\n\n```sh\nnpm run eject\n// or\nyarn eject\n```\n\n> -   At the first prompt, select 'Bare (first option)'\n> -   At the second prompt, accept the default value (press Enter). Changing this can cause issues running your project.\n> -   At the third prompt, enter a name for the solution folder.\n\nFor more information, read about [ejecting from Expo](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/customizing/).\n\n## Final Build\n\nAfter ejecting from Expo, the process for creating a build is the same as for a standard native application. You can open the project folders in xCode (/ios/projectName.xcodeproj) or Android Studio (/android) and perform builds from the IDE. There are also npm scripts added to your package.json file during ejection that will allow you to perform builds from the command line. Depending on the version of React Native you are using, you may have to [manually bundle your JS code](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44446523/unable-to-load-script-from-assets-index-android-bundle-on-windows) for Android.\n\n<Divider />\n\n# Additional Information\n\n## RNC CLI vs. Expo CLI\n\nThere are two popular approaches to starting a new React Native project. The first (recommended) is to use the [React Native Community CLI](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli) and the second is to use the [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/expo-cli/). The Expo CLI is nice for spinning up quick projects and demos, but to use certain libraries/plugins you will need to eject to vanilla React Native. For this reason, we recommend most production applications start with the RNC CLI instead to avoid the complications of ejecting.\n\n> **NOTE:** Brightlayer UI examples are written using the Expo CLI. The primary reason for this is because it provides the ability to share live-running code examples via [Snack](https://snack.expo.io/).\n\n## Code Formatting / Style\n\nPX Blue provides packages for code standards and style using ESLint and Prettier. These packages are used internally by the Brightlayer UI team, but they can also be used in your projects. You can find instructions for adding these packages to your project on [GitHub](https://github.com/brightlayer-ui/code-standards).\n\n> NOTE: the ESLint package is only available for TypeScript projects.\n\n## Component recommendations\n\nThere are a lot of resources and components available on the market to help speed up your development and improve reusability. React Native also comes with a built-in component library. We recommend the following:\n\n-   Navigation\n    -   [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) (JS-only implementation)\n    -   [React Native Navigation](https://wix.github.io/react-native-navigation/#/) (native implementation)\n-   Component Libraries\n    -   [React Native Built-in Components](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/components-and-apis.html)\n    -   [React Native Paper](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/)\n    -   [React Native Elements](https://react-native-training.github.io/react-native-elements/)\n\n## License Information\n\n[React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/LICENSE) is available under the MIT License.\n"

Despite the value and importance of testing, it is common for teams to overlook or neglect it. Testing should be considered from the very beginning of development, not as an afterthought once development is complete. In general, every time you write a new piece of code or update existing code, you should also write a test that verifies that your code is correct.\n\nThere are many [varieties of tests](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/software-testing/types-of-software-testing), each with their own intended purpose. The most common types of tests are:\n\n-   **Unit Tests**: verify individual methods, functions, or components.\n-   **Integration Tests**: verify that different modules or services in your application work together.\n-   **Functional Tests**: verify the output of certain actions based on business requirements.\n-   **End-to-end (E2E) Tests**: verify that user behaviors / workflows function as expected.\n-   **Acceptance Tests**: verify that the entire system meets the business requirements.\n-   **Performance Tests**: verify that the system behaves correctly under heavy load.\n-   **Smoke Tests: quick**: basic checks of the major features of the application.\n\nThis document focuses mainly on Unit Tests and E2E tests, as they are the easiest to automate.\n\n<Divider />\n\n# Unit Tests\n\nUnit tests target the smallest pieces of your application (such as verifying inputs and outputs of a class method or function). These will likely make up the bulk of your tests because they are quick to write, easy to automate, and can help you achieve significant code coverage.\n\n> Code Coverage measures the percentage of your code that is verified by your tests.\n\nA unit test shouldn't have any external dependencies, such as other methods or APIs. By keeping unit tests isolated in this manner, it's easy to identify the cause of a failing test and implement a fix quickly. When you start combining features and methods together, you move into the realm of _integration testing_.\n\n## When to Write\n\nAs long as you are writing tests and achieving acceptable levels of coverage, the _when_ is not as important.\n\nSome teams elect to follow a Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology, where unit tests are written prior to any code. In this situation the tests actually define the desired implementation of the application and the code is written to satisfy the tests.\n\nBehavior-Driven Development (BDD) is similar to TDD in that test cases are written prior to writing any applications code. However, these test cases focus more on the desired behavior (inputs and outputs) of the application, and less on the actual implementation. These are usually written in plain language rather than code.\n\nThe most important thing to keep in mind about tests is that they should provide confidence that the code and design are working as intended without issues in any scenario. For most teams, it's fine to write tests after features and functions are developed, so long as you write quality tests and achieve good coverage.\n\n## How to Write\n\nWhen unit testing components, the most effective tests are based on what is actually rendered on the screen rather than the internal implementation logic. The test should consider the application from the user's perspective and test things the user views and interacts with.\n\nFor example, consider testing an Open Button that should open a modal dialog when clicked. Your test should check that a button with the _Open_ label is rendered on the screen, and when it is clicked, the dialog is rendered on the screen with the correct content. You may be tempted to identify the button by a class or id, or test that a particular function is called when the button is pressed - these tests are not as effective because they are more likely to break if the implementation of the component changes, even though the end behavior is the same.\n\n-   Test what the user sees (i.e., rendered output) and what the user can do  (i.e., interactions).\n-   If there is visual change after an interaction, test for it.\n-   If there is a value returned after an action, test for it.\n\n## Testing Frameworks\n\nAngular, React, and React Native all come with built-in unit testing frameworks. Ionic can be unit tested using the same tools you would use for a standard Angular application.\n\n### Angular\n\nThe Angular CLI comes pre-configured with [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction) and [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/latest/index.html) for unit testing. When you create a new project, sample tests are created in your project for you (test files are identified by the `.spec.ts` file extension). You can execute the tests by running the following in your terminal:\n\n```sh\ncd your/project/root\nng test\n```\n\nThis will build your app and launch the browser with the test runner.\n\n### React\n\nThe Create React App CLI is pre-configured with the [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) testing framework. When creating a new project, a sample test is created in your project for you (test files are identified by the `.test.js` or `test.ts` file extension). You can execute the tests by running the following in your terminal:\n\n```sh\ncd your/project/root\nnpm run test\n// or\nyarn test\n```\n\nThis will run your tests and show the pass / fail output in the terminal.\n\nThere are additional test utilities that complement Jest well. [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) provides access to [React Testing Library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@testing-library/react) through the `react-dom` dependency. The Brightlayer UI team has also made use of [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/), a testing framework created by AirBnB, and [Test Renderer](https://reactjs.org/docs/test-renderer.html).\n\n### React Native\n\nLike React, the React Native CLI also bundles Jest into your application. Most of the testing strategies and libraries can be shared between the two frameworks. You can also consider additional libraries like [React Native Testing Library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@testing-library/react-native).\n\n### Ionic\n\nWhen creating an Ionic project with Angular, the Angular CLI is used to generate the underlying project, so you have access to all the same testing tools as you would with a regular Angular project.\n\n<Divider />\n\n# End-to-End Testing\n\nEnd-to-end tests at a step above unit tests, both in terms of complexity and what they test. They focus primarily on the flow of the application, making sure that a user's journey through the application has the expected outcomes. These tests can generally be categorized as:\n\n-   **Acceptance Tests**: verify that various features and flows meet the customer expectations.\n-   **Regression Tests**: verify that existing functionality is not broken when new features are added.\n\nThey should cover user stories that span multiple components and views, such as signing up for an accounts, logging in and out of the application, updating a profile, etc. These tests are not concerned with the underlying state or implementation of the application - just the end results.\n\nEnd-to-end tests usually run in a browser against a live system (in the case of web, using a test runner that automates the browser). Automated E2E tests can take a long time to run because of all of the different pieces involved and the scope of the tests. You should try to optimize your testing pipeline to run tests in parallel to finish faster.\n\nFunctional tests alone will not give you enough test coverage to avoid regressions. Unit tests aim to provide code coverage depth, while functional tests provide coverage over the breadth of user test scenarios.\n\n## How to Write\n\nEnd-to-end tests rely on the ability to find elements on the screen and interact with them in an automated way. This means that you need a reliable mechanism for selecting elements. Depending on your testing framework, there are different ways to select elements, including:\n\n-   **CSS Selectors**: find elements by using CSS classes or rules (e.g., `.your-class-name`)\n-   **Element Selectors**: find elements inside the elements (e.g., `#\\@\\@blui-drawerlayout-content > div > header > div > button`)\n-   **xPath Selectors**: find selector within xPath (e.g., `//*[@id=\"@@blui-drawerlayout-content\"]/div/header/div/button`)\n-   **ID Selectors**: find attribute id within elements (e.g., `#login-button`)\n\n> You can read more about different selector strategies on [browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/css-selectors-in-selenium) and [software testing help](https://www.guru99.com/find-element-selenium.html).\n\nEach of these methods has their own advantages and disadvantages. A common pain point in E2E test automation is that modern Javascript platforms are constantly changing, particularly in the open source community. Many of these frameworks automatically (and dynamically) generate IDs and classes for components resulting in a constantly moving target for automation tooling. Identifying elements by these values (i.e., using IDs, CSS, or xPath locators _without_ property attributes) makes your tests brittle because they are subject to change any time a new version comes out (or even any time the page is reloaded).\n\nOne way to combat this in your own applications is to use dedicated attributes for testing (e.g., `test-id` or `dev-id`). By adding this test-specific attribute to the element, identifying the correct underlying component should be safer. Because this attribute is test-specific and the application logic does not use it, it will be less likely to change throughout the product lifecycle. Combining this approach with other selectors is a common and reliable approach for element identification.\n\n```html\n<!-- Component code -->\n<button id=\"login-button\" class=\"default-button\">Login</button>\n\n<!-- Selector to use in a test -->\nWebElement click = driver.findElement(By.id(\"login-button\"));\n```\n\n## Testing Frameworks\n\nThere are many tools available for configuring automated E2E tests. Some of the more popular tools include:\n\n-   [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/)\n-   [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress.html#In-a-nutshell)\n-   [WebDriverIO](https://webdriver.io/docs/gettingstarted.html)\n\n### Selenium\n\nSelenium is a popular automation testing suite which can be used to automate the desktop and mobile web browser interactions. You can write test code in any of the languages supported by Selenium.\n\nSelenium test suite has several test frameworks available and each one can be customized to your project needs.\n\nFor more information, check out the browserstack [selenium guide](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/selenium-framework) or the official [selenium documentation](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium).\n\nThere are also a number of [Selenium tutorials](https://www.guru99.com/selenium-tutorial.html) available online to help you get started.\n\n### Cypress\n\nCypress is a popular open source testing framework that boasts support for any modern JavaScript framework. It works well for E2E tests in both Angular and React applications and is easier to use than some of the more traditional tools, such as Selenium.\n\nFor a more detailed write-up on Cypress, check out the official [Cypress Documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress.html#System-requirements).\n\n### WebDriverIO\n\nWebdriverIO is a popular Javascript based test automation framework built on top of node.js. It is an open-source project developed for the automation testing community. WebdriverIO is extendible, compatible and feature-rich.\n\nFor more information, check out the official [Webdriver.io documentation](https://webdriver.io/) and their [getting started guide](https://webdriver.io/docs/gettingstarted.html).\n\n<Divider />\n"

Brightlayer UI has many patterns and guidelines (color usage, typography, iconography, etc.) to address the most common elements and interactions that you might encounter when designing a product. By following these recommendations and using pre-defined resources from Brightlayer UI, your time is free to focus on the elements that make your project unique. In general, we recommend trying to use Brightlayer UI for 80% of your product's needs.\n\n## Environment\n\nWe host and maintain all [our design assets](/resources/designer) through Figma. Figma is a powerful prototyping tool that facilitates collaboration and sharing of design assets between teams. It can be used on the web, and they also provide a desktop app for Mac and Windows. In order to use Figma, you will need to [sign up](https://www.figma.com/) for an account.\n\n## Guidelines\n\nPX Blue has design guidelines that serve as the foundation for the design system. These are intentional design choices we made to shape the Brightlayer UI brand — what Brightlayer UI applications should look like and how users should interact with them.\n\n<LinkGrid links={patternLinks} style={{ marginTop: 16 }} />\n\n<Divider />\n\n# General Guidance\n\nThe best designs generally start with mobile first, and that's what we recommend as well when working with the Brightlayer UI design system. It's much easier to scale designs up than to scale them down. We also strongly encourage you to perform extensive user research to truly understand your users and their needs, skills, preferences, and tendencies.\n\n## Web Applications\n\nKeep the interface simple - avoid unnecessary elements and ensure the language used for labels and messaging is clear.\n\n<!--image-->\n\nStrive for consistency by using pre-defined Brightlayer UI UI elements where possible. By using these elements, your users will feel more familiar and will be able to get things done quickly. You can also help ensure consistency by defining patterns in language, layout, and design that are used throughout the application.\n\n<!--image-->\n\nBe purposeful when laying out page content. Consider space and the relationship between items on the page. Structure pages based on importance.\n\n<!--image-->\n\nUse the typography guidelines to create hierarchy and clarity. An effective type hierarchy increases scalability, legibility, and readability.\n\n<!--image-->\n\nEnsure that the application provides effective feedback to users. Make sure that you communicate location, actions, changes in state, and errors to users. Brightlayer UI has various UI elements to assist with communicating this information.\n\n<!--image-->\n\nConsider using defaults. If you have a strong understanding of the users of your application, careful planning around default states, actions, and paths can reduce the burden on your users.\n\n<!--image-->\n\n## Mobile Applications\n\nGenerally, interfaces less than seven inches in width should be treated as a mobile (phone) device. Font styles and layouts should be consistent across devices as much as possible - your product should feel like the same application regardless of the device used to access it. When working with a dedicated mobile app, familiarize yourself with device / platform capabilities and take advantage of these where possible.\n\n<!--image-->\n\nA fundamental principle for mobile design is to include only the information that is necessary. Don't overload the user with excessive information. Mobile devices are a convenient way to quickly consume information on the go and the information presented should reflect this.\n\n<!--image-->\n\nInterfaces greater than seven inches in width should be treated as a tablet device. As with phone devices, font styles and layouts should be consistent across devices in this class. However, you may find it appropriate to have some differences between phone and tablet devices because of the difference in screen real estate.\n\n<!--image-->\n\nTablet designs should look and feel like a desktop application / website, but they should function like a phone app.\n\n<!--image-->\n\nAs technology continues to evolve, it is important to consider scaling for the future. Products such as non-mobile touch screens, interactive displays, automotive displays, and touch screen laptops should be considered during your design phase.\n\n<!--image-->\n\n<Divider style={{}} />\n\n# Contributing\n\nWe encourage everyone to provide feedback, new design concepts, patterns, suggestions, or other ideas to help us create the most useful design system for our community. If you would like to contribute back, please [contact us](/community/contactus)!\n\nIn order to maintain the quality standards for Brightlayer UI resources, any submissions will be subject to review by the Brightlayer UI maintainers. If your design is made a part of Brightlayer UI, we'll add items onto our backlog to bring them to life in code for developers to use.\n"

When communicating with other members of the Brightlayer UI community, you should strive to use this terminology to promote effective collaboration and understanding. This is applicable to designers, developers, product managers, etc.\n\n<ImageGrid images={[CategoriesImg]} regularWidth caption={'The four levels of the Brightlayer UI design system hierarchy.'} />\n\n## Foundations\n\nThe foundations include the most basic visual elements on the page, such as [color](/style/color), [icons](/style/iconography), [typography](/style/typography), etc. These typically have no behavior or interaction on their own, but instead are used to communicate information to a user, establish a brand, or lay the foundations for the Brightlayer UI components, pages, and workflows.\n\n## Components\n\nComponents are the basic functional units of the UI. They are usually interactive through clicking, expanding, etc. Components can be as simple (such as buttons, tabs, sliders) or complex (such as [navigation drawers](/patterns/navigation)). Simpler components are often combined to form complex ones.\n\nMost of the simple components in Brightlayer UI are defined and built by Material Design and the component libraries that implement it. Brightlayer UI focuses on defining and building advanced components that are shared across Brightlayer UI applications.\n\n## Pages\n\nPages are the largest single unit in the Brightlayer UI design system. These are typically full-screen designs that specify how certain pages can look in an application. Foundation of these pages should stay the same while there may be some room for customizations. Examples of pages include \"login (empty fields)\" and \"create password (invalid)\".\n\n## Workflows\n\nWorkflows are a sequence of pages combined with rules surrounding how a user goes from one page to another. These usually represent a common path that a user is expected to take to complete various tasks. Workflows that are defined in Brightlayer UI are intended to be nearly identical between applications. Examples of very common workflows include the [login](/patterns/user-auth) experience and user registration / sign up.\n\n<Divider />\n\n# Design Patterns\n\n<RegularWidth>\n    <ImageGrid images={[PatternStatesImg]} regularWidth />\n</RegularWidth>\n\n[Design patterns](/patterns) are very common in Brightlayer UI. A design pattern is a common interaction or behavior that can exist at any level in the design system hierarchy described above. For example, we may have a design pattern for showing actions available on a list item or how to interact with individual settings on a settings page.\n\nBecause a design pattern centers around interactions, they typically include different states. A button can be normal, hovered, or pressed. Similarly, a login workflow can involve login with 2FA, Captcha, or simply a username and password.\n\nFor each state, Brightlayer UI tries to provide:\n\n-   Guidelines: How it's used and in what context\n-   Design Specifications: How it looks\n-   Interactions: How it goes from one state to another\n-   Code: How it can be implemented\n\n<Divider />\n\n# Brightlayer UI and the Atomic Design System\n\nIf you are familiar with other design systems, such as the [Atomic Design System](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/), you may recognize some concepts used here. Brightlayer UI's \"components\" parallel Atomic Design's atoms, molecules, and organisms. The idea of \"pages\" is the same in both systems, but Brightlayer UI also goes one level further in each direction (i.e., Foundations and Workflows) to define a project's user experience more comprehensively.\n"

Disabilities can come in many forms including visual, physical, auditory, etc. It is important to design your applications to be accessible, both to reach as wide an audience as possible and for potential legal reasons. Making your application accessible improves the user experience for individuals without disabilities as well.\n\n> For international products it is important to research what level of compliance is required by law — accessibility requirements vary from one country to another.\n\nThe best practice guidelines used internationally for making websites accessible are the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) (WCAG) 2.0, released by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 2008.\n\n<Divider />\n\n# Four Principles of Accessibility\n\nThere are four principles that lay the foundation necessary for anyone to access and use web content — Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust.\n\n## Perceivable\n\nInformation and user interface components must be presented to users in ways that they can perceive. For example, a button should look like a button and not be hidden behind an image or other hard-to-distinguish elements.\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[PerceivableDesignImg]}\n    regularWidth\n    caption={[\n        '1: The proper way to display a color picker on mobile.',\n        '2: An incorrect way to display a color picker on mobile. The color swatches do not look like buttons and clickable areas are too small.',\n    ]}\n/>\n\n## Operable\n\nOperable means that users must be able to perform the actions required to interact with interface elements. This means that all functionality should be available via the keyboard (including navigation), temporary content should be displayed long enough to be read by individuals with visual impairments, etc.\n\n## Understandable\n\nUsers must be able to consume information and interact with the application easily. This includes using appropriate language (avoiding abbreviations, writing at an appropriate reading level, etc.), making sure that interface elements behave in consistent and predictable ways, providing helpful error messages and instructions, etc.\n\nFor example, accompanying a button with a text label makes it more understandable if the meaning of the icon on its own is unclear.\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[UnderstandableDesignImg]}\n    regularWidth\n    caption={[\n        '1: The correct way to display an action for a card. The visible \"Read More\" button communicates to the user that there is additional content available to view.',\n        '2: The incorrect way to display an action for a card. It is not immediately clear that the card is clickable or that there is any way to see more content',\n    ]}\n/>\n\n## Robust\n\nWeb content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of users, including those who rely on assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers, text-to-speech software, alternative pointing devices, etc.). As assistive technologies advance, your applications will need to account for these advances.\n\n<Divider />\n\n# Color\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[AccessibilityDesignImg]}\n    regularWidth\n    caption={[\n        '1: An acceptable level of color contrast. On a white background, a ratio of 8.57:1 has been achieved, which is higher than required for AA and AAA compliance.',\n        '2: Acceptable use of contrasting colors within an application. Remember that icons should also be checked for at least AA compliance.',\n    ]}\n/>\n\nPX Blue colors and components have been tested to meet minimum accessibility requirements. By using these default styles, you should be able to reduce the effort required for your product to pass accessibility tests.\n\nIf your project requires the use of additional styles or colors, you should adhere to the following guidelines:\n\n-   Use Brightlayer UI colors in the 500+ range for white backgrounds.\n-   Avoid using yellow, red, and orange for text (except for single-line error messages on forms)\n-   Do not rely on colors for instructions (e.g., do not say \"Click the red button to close\")\n\nMost Brightlayer UI text elements use the Black 500 color, with some headlines using Blue 500. Button labels should use White 50 for dark background and Black 500 on light backgrounds. You can check the contrast ratio to determine which option provides greater contrast.\n\n<React.Fragment>\n    <MaterialDesignDescription\n        title={'W3C Guidelines'}\n        url={'https://www.w3.org/WAI/#'}\n        description={`Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0.`}\n        avatar={<LinkIcon style={{ width: 48, height: 48 }} />}\n    />\n    <MaterialDesignDescription\n        title={'Section 508 guidelines'}\n        url={'https://www.section508.gov#'}\n        description={`Rehabilitation Act of 1973`}\n        avatar={<LinkIcon style={{ width: 48, height: 48 }} />}\n    />\n    <MaterialDesignDescription\n        title={'European commission'}\n        url={'https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/web-accessibility'}\n        description={`Web accessibility allows everyone, including people with disabilities, to perceive, understand, navigate and interact with the Internet.`}\n        avatar={<LinkIcon style={{ width: 48, height: 48 }} />}\n    />\n</React.Fragment>\n\n## Checking Contrast\n\nLow contrast makes it difficult for all users to view your product, especially for individuals with visual impairments. You can test your contrast ratios using free [online tools](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) and [Figma plugins](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/732603254453395948/Stark).\n\n<Divider />\n\n# Text\n\nIn addition to making sure that the colors used for text are accessible, you should also ensure that text can be made larger without affecting the content or function of the page. Users with visual impairments may need to increase the font size of applications in order to read more clearly.\n\nMost browsers offer a feature for you to change the default font size (larger or smaller). You should test your application across multiple sizes to make sure that everything still looks right and functions correctly.\n\nMost Brightlayer UI components are designed to accommodate bigger font sizes when required.\n\n<Divider />\n\n# Images\n\nAny images in your application should be accompanied by a caption or other descriptive text, unless they are purely for decoration. Decorative images should show a brief description on hover. Images should always include an \"alt\" property so that they are accessible to users utilizing a screen-reader or other assistive technologies.\n\n-   Images should include descriptive text/alt text in the markup/code.\n-   Complex images should have more detailed descriptions near the image\n-   Videos must provide visual access to the audio information through in-sync captioning\n\n<Divider />\n\n# Testing Tools For Web\n\nThe tools used in the Trusted Tester Test Process (and ICT Testing Baseline) have been chosen based on several factors including ease of use, ease of teaching, and accuracy of results. They are also free to install and use.\n\n-   [Accessible Name & Description Inspector](https://www.ssa.gov/accessibility/andi/help/install.html) (ANDI)\n-   Color Contrast Analyzer for [Mac](https://github.com/ThePacielloGroup/CCA-OSX/releases/tag/2.4) and [Windows](https://github.com/ThePacielloGroup/CCA-Win/releases/tag/2.5.0) (CCA)\n"

However, it can also be adapted for use in traditional web sites as well.\n\n<ImageGrid regularWidth images={[WebsiteDesign]} caption={[`Photo by William Iven on Unsplash`]} />\n\n## Websites vs. Applications\n\nThe line between websites and web applications is often blurry. In general, websites primarily provide information in a read-only format for the purposes of education, promotion, marketing, etc.\n\nA web application is typically more interactive and provides users the ability to affect the data in the application (e.g., adding items, deleting items, etc.). These applications are typically built to serve a particular use case or function that users need to perform frequently.\n\nWebsites:\n\n-   Static content\n-   Usually publicly accessible\n-   Read-only visual & text content\n-   Less interactive / functional compared to web applications\n\nApplications:\n\n-   Dynamic content\n-   Often incorporates user accounts / authentication\n-   Users can manipulate data\n-   More interactive / functional compared to a website\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[Website, WebApp]}\n    caption={[\n        `Websites typically present read-only information to users, whereas web applications are more interactive and allow users to change the underlying data.`,\n        `Photos by Domenico Loia and Carlos Muza on Unsplash`,\n    ]}\n/>\n<Divider />\n\n# Principles of Website Design\n\nThere are several key principles for effective website design. Many of these principles can also be considered when designing a web application, with some notable differences called out below.\n\n## Beauty & Simplicity\n\nHow your website looks is important, but it's not the reason users are coming to your site — typically they are looking for some particular piece of information. However, users _will_ notice a bad design, so making sure your website is visually appealing is still crucial.\n\nKeeping your designs simple is a way to strike balance. You should avoid unnecessary design elements (i.e., don't design for the sake of design) — this will only serve to overwhelm users and make it more difficult for them to find what they are looking for. A clean and simple design helps the audience focus on the value of the brand and on your content. Often, users will associate a website design with the quality of a particular company or product.\n\n> Using whitespace liberally can help maintain a simplistic design and also improve readability.\n\n## Effective Navigation\n\nUsers are typically coming to your website to find information, so you should make your website as easy to navigate as possible to maximize their chance of finding what they need. User should be able to land on your site and immediately identify where they need to go.\n\n-   Primary navigation should be simple and located at the top of every page\n-   Include additional navigation or a site map in the footer of your website\n-   Consider adding breadcrumbs so users can quickly see where they are.\n    -   If you use breadcrumbs, they should be used on every page.\n-   Include a search functionality so users can quickly find what they are looking for\n-   Limit the number of navigation options (e.g., tabs, breadcrumbs, menus, etc.) per page\n-   Limit the nesting of information where possible.\n    -   Try to keep your website to no more than three levels deep (use a pyramid structure to organize your content).\n\n## Layout & Hierarchy\n\nWhere and how content is presented is a critical aspect of website design. You should arrange the elements on each page so that the user will naturally gravitate to the most important elements first. Your goal should be to facilitate users' actions in a way that feels intuitive, natural, and enjoyable. You can draw your users to certain elements on the page by utilizing a combination of position, size, and color.\n\nYour website should be designed on a [grid system](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/12/building-better-ui-designs-layout-grids/) to help tie elements together and promote responsiveness for different sized screens.\n\n<ImageGrid images={[Grid]} regularWidth caption={`Photo by Thomas Bredin-Grey`} />\n\n## Colors\n\nColor can be very powerful when it is used effectively. You should keep colors to a minimum to maximize the effect in the areas where they are used. We recommend using no more than five different colors in your website designs (ideally shades of blue, black, gray, and white from the Brightlayer UI [palette](/style/color)). For product catalogs or commerce sites, you should absolutely use the product's branding color(s) on your site.\n\nYou should focus your use of color on image backgrounds, highlight colors, etc.\n\n## Typography\n\nIn general, websites following the Brightlayer UI design language should use the Open Sans font. If you require an alternative, you should ensure that any font you use is highly legible at all sizes.\n\n-   Avoid using script fonts\n-   Minimize the use of colored text and make sure it contrasts with the background color.\n-   Use no more than three different typefaces.\n-   Use no more than three different font sizes.\n-   Keep body copy and label font sizes at 12px or larger\n    -   Do not use any text smaller than 8px\n\nYou can read more about typography in the [Typography](/style/typography) guide.\n\n## Graphics\n\nGraphics are most powerful when used sparingly. Only use graphics if they help the user complete a specific task or if they showcase a specific product / situation. You can read more about graphics in our [Illustrations](/style/illustrations) guide.\n\n## Consistency\n\nThe overall look and feel of your site should be consistent across pages. Backgrounds, colors, typefaces and the tone of writing are all areas where consistency has a positive impact on usability.\n\nConsistency does not mean every page should look identical. Try to define different layouts for specific types of pages (e.g., landing page, information page, product page, etc.). Use these layouts consistently throughout your website.\n\nIn addition to visual consistency, it is also important to maintain a consistent tone throughout the website. Your content should be written using the same voice throughout the website. Content should be descriptive and straight to the point — keep technical jargon to a minimum.\n\n## Responsiveness\n\nYour website should be functional across a wide range of different devices, including desktop computers, mobile phones, and tablets. Nearly 50% of all web traffic comes from mobile and tablet devices, so you should strive to follow a [mobile-first](https://medium.com/@Vincentxia77/what-is-mobile-first-design-why-its-important-how-to-make-it-7d3cf2e29d00) design strategy. Brightlayer UI is working to develop website grid templates for traditional website design in Figma. You can refer to [Material designs Responsive layout](https://material.io/design/layout/understanding-layout.html) grid for more detailed information.\n\n<ImageGrid regularWidth images={[ResponsiveDesignImg]} caption={[`Photo by Vincent Xia`]} />\n\n## Accessibility\n\nThe audience for a website can be even more diverse than for a web application. Your website should be accessible to all potential users. As with any Eaton digital product it is important to refer to the [Accessibility](/design/accessibility) guide for more detailed information. The main principles still apply to website design.\n\n## Conventions\n\nThere are a number of conventions that users have come to expect from websites. You should strive to follow these conventions when possible:\n\n-   Placing the main navigation at the top left or on the side of the site\n-   Placing a product logo at the top left of the site\n    -   The logo should be clickable and take the user back to the home page\n-   Links and buttons should change color / appearance when hovered over\n-   Ensuring image galleries / slideshows have buttons for users to manually rotate slides\n-   Use shopping cart icons on a commerce site.\n    -   Include a badge that indicates the number of items in the cart.\n\n<!--# Key Differences vs. Web Application-->\n"

However, the purpose of Brightlayer UI is not to make every application look the same.\n\nAs Brightlayer UI serves as a design system for a wide range of applications, some projects might demand unique design or branding elements to better suit their audience. There is a balance that you must strike among maintaining consistency between applications and establishing a unique brand for each product. Brightlayer UI provides some of the basic elements and patterns to help you build consistency, leaving you more time to focus on what makes your product unique.\n\n<MaterialDesignDescription\n    title={'Design Patterns'}\n    url={'/patterns'}\n    description={`Follow Brightlayer UI's design pattern guidelines.`}\n    avatar={<PxblueSmallAltIcon style={{ width: 48, height: 48 }} />}\n    minCardHeight={'unset'}\n/>\n\n## Brightlayer UI is Flexible\n\nPX Blue is not intended to stifle your creativity, but rather to enable it. Brightlayer UI standardizes some of the basic elements of design in order to foster consistency between projects, which in turn allows you to spend more of your time and creativity on the parts of your project that make it unique.\n\nJust as we build on top of [Material Design](https://material.io) principles, you too can build on top of Brightlayer UI principles to make your products better for your target audience. There are many opportunities in Brightlayer UI where you are free to make changes and tweaks.\n\n<ImageGrid\n    regularWidth\n    images={[ConsumerIndustrial]}\n    caption={[\n        `An example of two projects, both designed to control devices, but with a different targeted audience.`,\n        `1: A consumer-faced product. End users might be homeowners, small business owners, etc. The project is designed to delight the users.`,\n        `2: Industrial product. End users might be asset managers, facility assets managers, etc. The project is designed to  convey a secure and efficient picture for equipment management.`,\n    ]}\n/>\n\n## Build a Local Design System\n\nWe expect that you will establish your own local design system for your project that extends Brightlayer UI and adds your own style / identity. Depending on your use case, your design system may need to be more flashy, visual, relaxed, friendly, etc. Depending on where your application will be used, you may also need to change aspects of the design system related to accessibility (such as larger buttons for touch-screens) or legal requirements in your target markets.\n\n<ImageGrid\n    regularWidth\n    images={[StyleChoice]}\n    caption={[\n        `You may tune styles for your application away from the Brightlayer UI baseline style, as part of your local design system. In this example, the app bar (#1), the input form field (#2) and the buttons (#3) are changed.`,\n    ]}\n/>\n\nWhile establishing your local product identity, remember that Brightlayer UI is here to help establish consistency. You do not want to customize so much that this is lost. Below, we go into details about some common areas of customization as well as some areas that should be avoided.\n\n## Common Things to Change\n\nThere are some areas where we strongly encourage you to make changes and establish your own brand identity.\n\nKeep in mind that once you've established a local design system, you must make sure that you apply it consistently everywhere. You should use it in your packaging, your website, your email templates, the application, etc.\n\n### Illustrations\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[IllustrationConsumer, IllustrationIndustrial]}\n    caption={[\n        `A consumer-oriented product (#1) might use an illustration for empty states, while an industrial product (#2) might use an icon instead.`,\n    ]}\n/>\n\n[Illustrations](/style/illustrations) are common for [websites](/design/websites) and other consumer-facing products. Different image styles can create different moods (e.g., friendly vs. professional) and set the tone for how users will use your application.\n\n### Images\n\nSimilar to illustrations, images are another way to make your applications and websites more user-friendly.\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[ImageAppBar, ImageDrawerRegular, ImageDrawerProfile, ImageScorecardHeader, ImageLogin, ImageSuccess]}\n    caption={[\n        `There are many opportunities where you can apply background images or tiles to promote your brand identity.`,\n        `1: Background image on an extended app bar.`,\n        `2: Background tile on a drawer header.`,\n        `3: Background tile on a drawer .`,\n        `4: Background images on the header of scorecards.`,\n        `5: Background tiles on a login screen on the desktop.`,\n        `6: Geometric shape on a login card.`,\n        `7: Wavy, delightful background pattern for account creation success screen.`,\n    ]}\n/>\n\n### Icons\n\nPX Blue primarily uses the baseline style of Material Design's icons (see [our iconography](/style/iconography)).\n\nHowever, we understand that the current iconography set may not cover every single use case or requirement for your product. In these situations, you are welcome to invent your own icons or leverage [Material Design's community icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/). Before going this route, make sure that you have thoroughly explored the available icons first and when creating new icons, ensure that they follow the [Material Design icon design guidelines](https://material.io/design/iconography/system-icons.html#design-principles).\n\n### Component Variants\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[VariationButton, VariationTextField]}\n    caption={'Buttons and text fields have many style variations.'}\n/>\n\nMany components have style variations. These variations are all available for you to use, and it is up to you to decide which ones work best for your application. Some common variations include:\n\n-   Outlined vs. Contained / Filled\n-   Flat vs. Elevated\n-   Square vs. Rounded Corner vs. Round\n\n### Verbiage\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[VerbiageNeutral, VerbiageExcitement]}\n    caption={`Depends on the industry of your product, sometimes you want to sound more neutral and professional (#1), while other times you might want to cheer up your user through an (often cumbersome) configuration workflow (#2).`}\n/>\n\nThe actual text used in your application can change based on your intended tone. For websites, you may want to use more persuasive and appealing language to encourage the audience to buy or use your product. Inside an application, you may want to use a more serious tone, especially for applications that deal with potential safety concerns. Consumer-facing products in general carry a more cheerful tone.\n\n<MaterialDesignDescription\n    title={'Writing'}\n    url={`https://material.io/design/communication/writing.html`}\n    description={`Material Design's language principles for user interface.`}\n/>\n\n## Things You Should NEVER Change\n\nWhen it comes to Brightlayer UI, you have a great deal of design freedom, but there are a few things you should never change. Most of these are related to maintaining visual consistency and other conventions between applications.\n\n### Theme\n\nPX Blue [offers two themes](/style/themes): Blue theme and Blue Dark theme. Ideally, an application should support both themes, but some applications might be more usable depending on the environment and context of the usage.\n\nYou are expected to stay close to those two themes. Both themes have been thoroughly researched to ensure they meet the standards for usability and accessibility.\n\n> One notable exception to this rule is if you are building products that will be white-labeled or sold under a different brand. In this case, you may find it beneficial to create your own custom themes that will better align with the brand.\n\n### Status Colors\n\n<ImageGrid images={[ListColorCorrect, ListColorIncorrect]} caption={'Do not break color conventions.'} />\n\nPX Blue has strict guidelines around our [status color palette](/style/color). The status colors are used to indicate the status of certain items or devices. These should not be changed for any reason — users should be able to instantly know what these colors mean in any Brightlayer UI application. Further, the colors you are using to brand your application should not interfere with these colors.\n\nThe only situation where these may be changed is if there is an industry-specific convention that differs from the Brightlayer UI recommendations (e.g., green = circuit closed, red = circuit open for breakers). In these situations, you should follow the industry-specific convention.\n\n### Font Family\n\nPX Blue [uses Open Sans and Noto Sans](/style/typography) for all applications. You are encouraged to adjust font [weight and size](/style/typography#customization) where necessary to establish a visual type hierarchy, but we strongly discourage the use of any fonts other than Open Sans and Noto Sans, particularly any [Serif fonts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serif).\n\n### Design Patterns\n\nThroughout our [design patterns](/patterns), we provide examples of \"things not to do\" — these are typically identified by an image with a red underline. You should never use any of these expressly-forbidden patterns in your products. In all cases, we provide an example of the preferred approach.\n"

There are several ways to present this information to the user in a Brightlayer UI application.\n\n<React.Fragment>\n    <TOC\n        anchors={[\n            { title: 'Introduction', hash: '#account-menu' },\n            { title: 'Account Settings Page', hash: '#account-settings-page' },\n            { title: 'In a Navigation Drawer', hash: '#in-a-navigation-drawer' },\n            { title: 'In a User Menu', hash: '#in-a-user-menu' },\n            { title: 'Contents', hash: '#contents' },\n            { title: 'Design Specifications', hash: '#design-specifications' },\n            { title: 'Developers', hash: '#developers' },\n        ]}\n    />\n    <Divider />\n</React.Fragment>\n\n# Account Settings Page\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[AccountSettingsPage]}\n    regularWidth\n    caption={`A typical account settings page on mobile and web displaying user information and various account-related options.`}\n/>\n\nAt a minimum, your application should implement a dedicated account settings page for viewing and editing a user's account details, preferences, settings, etc. This page should also include a way for users to take account-related actions. The style of this page should be consistent with other settings pages in your application, if applicable. If you have multiple settings pages in your application, the account settings should be easily accessible from the top level.\n\n<React.Fragment>\n    <Divider />\n</React.Fragment>\n\n# In a Navigation Drawer\n\nIf your application is using [Drawer Navigation](/patterns/navigation#drawer-navigation), you can include quick-access user information and actions in the Drawer. Commonly, this involves placing an avatar in the drawer header along with basic information about the user (e.g., their name, username, email address, job title and / or organization affiliation). Additional account actions and a link to the account settings page can be placed at the bottom of the drawer body, just above the footer, if present (see the [contents](/patterns/account-menu#contents) section below).\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[DrawerDetails1, DrawerDetails2]}\n    caption={[\n        `1. User avatar and basic information can be placed in the drawer header.`,\n        `2. Place the top account-related actions at the bottom of the drawer.`,\n    ]}\n/>\n\nThis approach is most effective when there are relatively few account-related actions and is also preferred on mobile where there is limited space in the app bar.\n\nIf you are using a navigation rail, you may place account settings links in the rail, but you will not be able to show specific details about the user. Consider using the [User Menu](#via-user-menu) in this situation or if you are using a primary navigation mechanism other than a drawer.\n\n<React.Fragment>\n    <DemoCard\n        repository={'Account Details in Drawers'}\n        angular={`https://stackblitz.com/github/brightlayer-ui/angular-design-patterns/tree/master?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpages%2Faccount-menu%2Fin-a-drawer%2Fmenu-in-a-drawer.component.html`}\n        react={`https://codesandbox.io/s/github/brightlayer-ui/react-design-patterns/tree/master?file=/src/pages/account-menu/in-a-drawer/index.tsx&initialpath=in-a-drawer`}\n    />\n    <MaterialDesignDescription\n        title={'Drawer Navigation'}\n        url={'/patterns/navigation#drawer-navigation'}\n        description={`Follow Brightlayer UI's guideline for using a Drawer.`}\n        avatar={<PxblueSmallAltIcon style={{ width: 48, height: 48 }} />}\n    />\n    <Divider />\n</React.Fragment>\n\n# In a User Menu\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[UserMenuContents]}\n    regularWidth\n    caption={[\n        `1.

The user menu appears as an Avatar in the [App Bar](/patterns/appbar) which opens a menu with the user-related content (see the [contents](#contents) section below).\n\nThis approach is most effective if you have more than three account-related actions, or if you want to present more detailed information about a user since it avoids cluttering the primary navigation drawer.\n\n<React.Fragment>\n    <DemoCard\n        repository={'User Menus in App Bars'}\n        angular={`https://stackblitz.com/github/brightlayer-ui/angular-design-patterns/tree/master?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpages%2Faccount-menu%2Fin-an-app-bar%2Fin-an-app-bar.component.html`}\n        react={`https://codesandbox.io/s/github/brightlayer-ui/react-design-patterns/tree/master?file=/src/pages/account-menu/in-an-app-bar/index.tsx&initialpath=in-an-app-bar`}\n    />\n    <MaterialDesignDescription\n        title={'Bottom Sheet'}\n        url={'/patterns/overlay#bottom-sheet'}\n        description={`Follow Brightlayer UI's guideline for using a Bottom Sheet.`}\n        avatar={<PxblueSmallAltIcon style={{ width: 48, height: 48 }} />}\n    />\n    <Divider />\n</React.Fragment>\n\n# Contents\n\nWhether you are using the drawer or a dedicated user menu component, the content should be very similar.\n\n## Avatar\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[AvatarVariants]}\n    regularWidth\n    caption={[\n        `1.

It may appear in the drawer header or in the [App Bar](/patterns/appbar).\n\nAvatars can take several forms. Usually, they display a user-selected profile picture. If your application does not support user-selected images, you can default to displaying the user's initials or a [person icon](/style/iconography?icon=Person&isMaterial=true). You can also elect to show the user's full name or username — this may be particularly useful when your application uses shared or generic accounts (e.g., 'Administrator').\n\nThe avatar should be accompanied by basic information about the user, such as their name, username, email, job title, etc., which can be placed in the navigation drawer header or in the user menu header.\n\n## Account Functions\n\nMost account functions can be located on the account settings page, but you should provide access to the most common / frequent actions in the drawer or user menu as well.\n\nYou should at least include:\n\n-   A link to the account settings page\n-   A Log Out button\n-   Links to terms of service / privacy policy / license information (if applicable)\n\nWhen using the user menu, you will likely have more room available if you wish to include other frequently accessed account functions, such as change password, contact support, etc.\n\n<React.Fragment>\n    <ImageGrid\n        images={[CrowdedDrawer, CrowdedUserMenu]}\n        caption={`Avoid overcrowding the drawer and the user menu by including too many user actions.`}\n    />\n    <Divider />\n</React.Fragment>\n\n# Design Specifications\n\n## Mobile\n\n### Navigation Drawer\n\n<ImageGrid images={[Specs3]} regularWidth />\n\n### User Menu\n\n<ImageGrid images={[Specs1]} regularWidth />\n\n### Avatar\n\n<ImageGrid images={[Specs4]} regularWidth />\n\n## Desktop and Tablet\n\nIf certain dimensions are not specified, refer to the dimensions suggested in the mobile section above.\n\n### User Menu\n\n<ImageGrid images={[Specs2]} regularWidth />\n\nAlso refer to the design specifications for [Drawer](/patterns/navigation#design-specifications) and [Bottom Sheet](/patterns/overlay#bottom-sheet).\n\n<Divider />\n\n# Developers\n\nUse the following components to implement this pattern:\n\n**Angular** and **Ionic**:\n\n-   Angular Material\n    -   [Side Nav](https://material.angular.io/components/sidenav/overview)\n-   @brightlayer-ui/angular-components\n    -   [Drawer](https://brightlayer-ui-components.github.io/angular/?path=/info/components-drawer--readme)\n    -   [User Menu](https://brightlayer-ui-components.github.io/angular/?path=/info/components-user-menu--readme)\n\n**React**:\n\n-   Material UI\n    -   [Drawer](https://mui.com/components/drawers/)\n-   @brightlayer-ui/react-components\n    -   [Drawer](https://brightlayer-ui-components.github.io/react/?path=/info/components-drawer--get-read-me-story)\n    -   [User Menu](https://brightlayer-ui-components.github.io/react/?path=/info/components-user-menu--get-read-me-story)\n\n**React Native**:\n\n-   @brightlayer-ui/react-native-components\n    -   [Drawer](https://brightlayer-ui-components.github.io/react-native/?path=/info/components-documentation--drawer)\n    -   [User Menu](https://brightlayer-ui-components.github.io/react-native/?path=/info/components-documentation--user-menu)\n"

This allows you the flexibility to present an eye-catching banner without permanently reducing the amount of usable space on the page. This pattern is most commonly used for mobile applications, but could also be used for web.\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[CollapsibleAppBarDynamic, CollapsibleAppBarSnap]}\n    caption={[\n        `Collapsible app bars can have two slightly different behaviors: 'dynamic', which resizes proportionally to the scroll position (first image), and  'snap', which collapses in one step once the user scrolls pass a certain threshold (second image). You should avoid using collapsible app bars on pages that do not have significant amounts of scrollable content to prevent situations where the app bar can only be partially collapsed or not collapsed at all.`,\n    ]}\n/>\n\nThe collapsible appbar should transition smoothly between the expanded and collapsed states — this means you will need to account for how the app bar will look throughout the transition. Because elements will disappear as the app bar shrinks, you'll need to use various transition techniques to do this smoothly, depending on your content.\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[HideOnCollapse]}\n    caption={[\n        `When a collapsible app bar (#1) collapses, you may choose to either hide the third line of text (#2) or the second line of text (#3), but the page title (first line) should never be hidden (#4).`,\n    ]}\n    regularWidth\n/>\n\n<Divider />\n\n# Search\n\n<React.Fragment>\n    <ImageGrid\n        images={[SiteSearch, PageSearch, ComponentSearch]}\n        caption={[\n            '1: Global (application-wide) search is always placed in the primary app bar.',\n            '2: Page-wide search can be placed below the primary app bar when searching content on a single page or screen.',\n            '3: Component-wide search allows the user to search for contents within individual components (e.g., cards, lists).',\n        ]}\n    />\n</React.Fragment>\n\nA very common pattern seen in many types of applications is the ability to search for data.\n\n<DemoCard\n    repository={'Global Search'}\n    angular={`https://stackblitz.com/github/brightlayer-ui/angular-design-patterns/tree/master?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpages%2Fapp-bar%2Fsearch-bar%2Fsearch-bar.component.html`}\n    react={`https://codesandbox.io/s/github/brightlayer-ui/react-design-patterns/tree/master?file=/src/pages/app-bar/search-bar/index.tsx&initialpath=search`}\n    reactNative\n/>\n\n<DemoCard\n    repository={'Page-Wide Search'}\n    angular={`https://stackblitz.com/github/brightlayer-ui/angular-design-patterns/tree/master?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpages%2Fapp-bar%2Fpage-wide-search%2Fpage-wide-search.component.html`}\n    react={`https://codesandbox.io/s/github/brightlayer-ui/react-design-patterns/tree/master?file=/src/pages/app-bar/page-wide-search/PageWideSearch.tsx&initialpath=page-wide-search`}\n    reactNative\n/>\n\n## Search Bar\n\nThe search bar is used primarily when your search is a global search of all application content or when search is the primary interaction on a particular screen. This mode of search is achieved by placing a search icon/button in the primary app bar. When this button is clicked, a white search bar slides in from the right to cover the default app bar. As the user enters text into the search field, the data is filtered in real-time. A back icon will close the Search Bar and clear the search results.\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[Search]}\n    caption={'When the search icon is clicked, a white search bar will slide in and cover the default tool bar. '}\n/>\n\n## Auto-complete\n\nFor more advanced searching, you may wish to include an auto-complete feature. You can implement autocomplete by including a contextual menu below the search bar with suggested search items. Alternatively, you can use type-ahead to automatically update the recommended search query in the search field as the user types (Google search does this).\n\n<React.Fragment>\n    <ImageGrid\n        regularWidth\n        images={[AutoVariants]}\n        caption={[\n            '1.

As the name suggests, they can alert users to empty data, but they can also be used to indicate:\n\n-   No Data Available\n-   Empty Search/Filter Results\n-   Networking Errors\n-   Lack of Permissions\n-   Future Features / Placeholders\n-   Success Screens\n\nEmpty states should **NOT** be used for:\n\n-   [Loading indicators](/patterns/loading)\n-   Welcome Screens\n\n<Divider />\n\n# Anatomy\n\nEmpty states should include a large icon or graphic followed a brief headline/message. If necessary, additional explanatory text may follow.\n\nThe text on the screen should clearly indicate why there is no data to display, and what (if anything) can be done to make data available. The text should be minimal, but enough to convey the necessary message.\n\nIf the data is empty but could be populated by a user action (such as adding a device to an empty device list), there should be a call-to-action button that will allow the user to add data.\n\n## Variations\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[DesktopImage, ElementImage]}\n    caption={['1: A full-screen empty state.', '2: Empty state shown on an element (card).']}\n/>\n\n### Full-screen\n\nIn the most common cases, Empty States should be used full-screen as the only content on a page. In this situation, the indicator should be centered on the page. In some cases, you may wish to use a large graphic as the background of the entire page as well (such as for features that will be coming soon).\n\n### Element-level\n\nWhile less common, empty states can also be used as an indicator for individual sections of a page rather than the entire page (such as a single card having no data on a dashboard / overview screen). In these cases, it may be appropriate to use a smaller icon and text depending on the available space.\n\n<Divider />\n\n# Behavior\n\nThe empty state should clearly communicate to users:\n\n-   What they are looking at: What data will be present if the dataset is not empty?\n-   Why the state is empty: What actions (or inactions) did they perform that caused the dataset to be empty?\n-   How to get the data: What actions do they need to take to populate the data, if needed?\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[DontDistractImage, DoEncourageImage]}\n    caption={\n        'Do not display pagination when datasets are empty as they can be distracting to users. Instead, provide instructions to help your user out of the empty state situation, if so desired by your application.'\n    }\n/>\n\nEmpty states can also be a great place to express your project identity, especially if your application is designed to be consumer-facing.

Inputs should be approximately as wide as their expected input values (or full width on mobile). Follow the Material Design [guidelines](https://material.io/components/selection-controls#specs) for when to use different selection controls.\n -->\n\n## Field Requirements\n\nRequired / optional fields should be identified according to the Material Design guidelines. If your form fields have complex requirements for valid values, you can list these criteria below the input. A common use case for this is when displaying password complexity requirements.\n\n<ImageGrid images={[Image4, Image5, Image6]} caption={'A common application of form validation — reset password.'} />\n<DemoCard\n    repository={'Password'}\n    angular={`https://stackblitz.com/github/brightlayer-ui/angular-design-patterns/tree/master?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpages%2Fforms-and-validation%2Fpassword%2Fpassword.component.html`}\n    react={`https://codesandbox.io/s/github/brightlayer-ui/react-design-patterns/tree/master?file=/src/pages/form-validation/password/index.tsx&initialpath=password`}\n/>\n\n## Error Messages\n\nIf there is an error with the data entered into a field, the field should indicate to the user that there is a problem. Label and helper text should be changed to a red color and the error message should be displayed in the helper text location below the field — any existing helper text should be replaced with the error message. You may optionally show an additional error icon in the text input.\n\nError messages should be succinct and should not provide information that could compromise security (e.g., use \"Invalid Credentials\" instead of \"Incorrect Password\").\n\n## Success Screens\n\nOnce a user has reached the end of a form successfully, you should present them with a success screen. This screen should indicate to the user that their submission was accepted and offer information about the next steps (e.g., \"Click the finish button below to log in.\"). Typically these success screens are stylized for your application and will include some bold graphics or [illustrations](/style/illustrations).\n\n## Mobile Keyboard\n\nMobile devices offer multiple different software keyboard variations for different types of inputs. Make sure that you are using the appropriate keyboard for your inputs (e.g., use the email keyboard for email inputs, phone number keyboard for a phone number field, etc.).\n\nTypically, mobile devices also allow you to change the label on the return key of the software keyboard. This label should be appropriate to the context (see [Submitting the Form](/patterns/forms#submitting-the-form) below).\n\nThe focused input field should remain centered in the screen when the software keyboard is open — it should not be hidden behind the keyboard.\n\n## Password Visibility\n\nDepending on the security requirements of your application, it may be useful to add a password visibility toggle button to fields where users must enter a password (such as during login or changing a password). The visibility toggle switches the input type between hidden text and plain text so users can ensure that they typed their password correctly.\n\n<Divider />\n\n# Behaviors\n\n## Verifying User Input\n\nIn general, there are three acceptable times to perform form field verification:\n\n-   on blur: the field is verified when the user clicks away from it\n-   on change: the field is dynamically verified on each keystroke or change in the value\n-   on action: fields are verified after performing a specific action, such as clicking a button\n\n### Verifying on Blur\n\nIn order to avoid distracting or confusing users, most text fields should verify input when the field loses focus. Error messages should not appear until the user is finished entering data and the field is no longer in focus.\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[OnBlurImage]}\n    regularWidth\n    caption={[\n        '1: Do not check for validity or display error messages when the user is typing in the field.',\n        '2: The user is finished and the input has lost focus (i.e., \"blurred\"). Now the input should be verified.',\n    ]}\n/>\n\n<DemoCard\n    repository={'Phone Number Format'}\n    angular={`https://stackblitz.com/github/brightlayer-ui/angular-design-patterns/tree/master?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpages%2Fforms-and-validation%2Fphone-number-format%2Fphone-number-format.component.html`}\n    react={`https://codesandbox.io/s/github/brightlayer-ui/react-design-patterns/tree/master?file=/src/pages/form-validation/phone-number-format/index.tsx&initialpath=phone-number-format`}\n/>\n\n### Verifying on Change\n\nSome fields should verify the user input as it changes. The most common case for this type of verification is a new password field or a confirm password field. The verification feedback should be displayed / updated each time the user makes a change to the input field.\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[OnChangeImage]}\n    regularWidth\n    caption={[\n        '1: The password criteria checks shall be updated as the user changes their input.',\n        '2: “Confirm Password” field should check for a match with password to give immediate feedback for when the user can proceed.',\n    ]}\n/>\n\n### Verifying on Action\n\nIn some specific situations, you may need to defer verification or perform it for all fields in a form at once. In this case, you need to link verification to a specific action, such as clicking a button.\n\nThis type of verification is common when the checks cannot be performed on the client, such as making an API call to verify a registration code, check user login credentials, or search for a device on the network. In most cases, you can do some preliminary checks using one of the two methods above (e.g., you can check if the email is a valid email before making the API call to verify the credentials).\n\nIf verification is being triggered by clicking on a button, you should replace the button text with a loading spinner while the verification is in progress. If the verification is successful, the user should be automatically taken to the next screen.\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[OnSubmitImage]}\n    regularWidth\n    caption={[\n        'After the user clicks the submit button, the app waits for the server response, and displays an error message.',\n    ]}\n/>\n\n<DemoCard\n    repository={'Verify on Submit'}\n    angular={`https://stackblitz.com/github/brightlayer-ui/angular-design-patterns/tree/master?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpages%2Fforms-and-validation%2Fverify-on-submit%2Fverify-on-submit.component.html`}\n    react={`https://codesandbox.io/s/github/brightlayer-ui/react-design-patterns/tree/master?file=/src/pages/form-validation/verify-on-submit/index.tsx&initialpath=verify-on-submit`}\n/>\n\n## Submitting the Form\n\nForms should have a button to submit the data or continue to the next part of the form if there are multiple parts. Depending on what happens next, the button should be labeled _Next_, _Finish_, or similar. The button should be located at the bottom right corner of the form (bottom left for right-to-left languages).\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[SubmitButtonLocationImage]}\n    regularWidth\n    caption={[\n        '1: On desktops, the button is placed in the bottom corner of the form.',\n        '2: On mobile, the software keyboard has different options for the action button',\n    ]}\n/>\n\nOn mobile, if there are multiple input fields on the screen, the keyboard action button should say \"next\", unless you are on the last item of the page, in which case the keyboard button should say \"done\" or \"submit\". This button can either submit the form or simply dismiss the keyboard (if you want users to have a chance to review their information first).\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[NextButtonUsageImage]}\n    regularWidth\n    caption={[\n        ,\n        '1: The user entered a valid input.

You can accomplish this in your applications or websites by considering the differences in language, scripts, and directionality.\n\nInternationalization, sometimes abbreviated as \"I18N,\" refers to the process of designing products that are functionally independent of interfaces or interactions that rely on a specific language or cultural context. This process enables products or services to be equally experienced by people using any language or from any cultural background. Localization, sometimes written as \"L10N,\" concerns adapting or customizing a product to some specific areas. Internationalization and localization are both crucial in making your application prosper in a global market.\n\nYou should always consider Internationalization during the design process, especially if there is a vision for reaching our Global market. Understanding and capturing possible needs for localization should begin at the outset of any new product development, even if the short-term goal is focused on only one market.\n\n<React.Fragment>\n    <TOC\n        anchors={[\n            { title: 'Introduction', hash: '#internationalization--localization' },\n            { title: 'Changing Locales', hash: '#changing-locales' },\n            { title: 'Developers', hash: '#developers' },\n        ]}\n    />\n    <Divider />\n</React.Fragment>\n\n# Changing Locales\n\n<MaterialDesignDescription\n    title={'Language Support'}\n    url={`https://material.io/design/typography/language-support.html#language-considerations`}\n/>\n\n## Translation\n\nTo localize your application content, you should create a string resource file or object that contains the translations for any display text used in your application. Do not have any text hard-coded in your application's UI. To switch your application to another language, you simply toggle the file/object used to populate the UI to the appropriate translation.\n\n## Showing Language Options\n\n<ImageGrid images={[LanguageOptionsImage]} regularWidth />\n\nLanguage options are typically presented in the user preferences or settings section of an application. In the case where users do not require an account, such as on a public-facing website, the language option is expected in the app bar or in the footer. You should provide cues, such as an icon, to help users locate the language selection.\n\nWhen showing a list of languages, the language names should be presented in their own language (i.e., use \"Español\", not \"Spanish\").\n\n## Converting Units, Currencies, and Formats\n\nUnits, currency, and formats are usually linked with a particular locale. However, there can be differences in usage even within a single locale. You should provide users with the option to change these values (if appropriate for your application) in their locale settings.\n\nSome commonly influenced formats include:\n\n-   Phone number\n-   Names (e.g., given name vs. surname order)\n-   Address (e.g., street name first or country name first)\n-   Date and time\n-   Numbers (comma vs. period)\n-   Punctuation\n\nConsider your global audience when crafting forms — you may need to support multiple input formats such as for a phone number.\n\n<ImageGrid images={[FormsImage]} caption={'Allow the users to put in an international phone number.'} regularWidth />\n\n## Checking for Layout\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[ButtonWidthImage, TextFieldWidthImage]}\n    caption={[\n        '1: Buttons with different width.',\n        '2: Error message in English.',\n        '3: Same error message in Malayalam can result in line wrapping.',\n    ]}\n/>\n\nDifferent languages or writing systems may require different vertical and horizontal space. To ensure flexibility, avoid using fixed dimensions for UI components such as buttons, labels, and badges. Also, consider setting different default display font sizes for languages that may have smaller glyphs.\n\n> **NOTE:** Brightlayer UI recommends using [Noto Sans](https://www.google.com/get/noto/#sans-lgc) for all non-western languages. You can read more on our [Typography](/style/typography) page.\n\n## Bidirectionality / Right-to-Left (RTL) Support\n\n<MaterialDesignDescription\n    title={'Bidirectionality'}\n    description={'Learn about mirroring layout, mirroring elements, and localization.'}\n    url={`https://material.io/design/usability/bidirectionality.html`}\n/>\n\nSome languages, such as Arabic and Hebrew, are read from right to left. Applications supporting these languages will need to mirror the UI so the natural flow is from right to left. For example, navigation drawers should be displayed on the right side of the screen, icons should be to the right of the text in buttons, and [any icons with directionality](https://material.io/design/usability/bidirectionality.html#mirroring-elements) should be mirrored.\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[UIFlippedImage]}\n    regularWidth\n    caption={[\n        '1: A Brightlayer UI user interface in right-to-left language (English).',\n        '2: The same Brightlayer UI user interface in left-to-right language (Arabic).',\n    ]}\n/>\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[IconsFlippedImage]}\n    regularWidth\n    caption={[\n        '1: Icons that indicate directions should be mirrored.',\n        '2: Icons with glyphs and symbols should never be mirrored.',\n    ]}\n/>\n<MaterialDesignDescription\n    title={'Which icons should be mirrored for RTL?'}\n    description={'A list of Material icons that should be mirrored in a RTL UI.'}\n    url={`http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#which-icons-should-be-mirrored-for-rtl-`}\n    avatar={<LinkIcon style={{ width: 48, height: 48 }} />}\n/>\n\n## Cultural Differences\n\n<ImageGrid images={[CulturalDifferencesImage]} regularWidth />\n\nAddressing cultural differences is the key concern of localization. Sometimes certain UI elements convey different meaning in different cultures. For example, in America, the red color in the stock market indicates a decline, while in China the same color indicates a rise. A thumbs-up gesture usually expresses an approval in English-speaking country, yet the gesture can have a negative meaning in Iraq. When designing for a new market, you are encouraged to have a local consultant run an audit for your application.\n\nWhen you are designing for webpages, instead of applications, your primary goal is to advertise your products and services, and appeal to the local market. The language tone, page style, and choice of image assets are expected to be tailored for different targeted culture. Likewise, your user study and market research conclusions derived under a certain cultural background might not apply to another culture.\n\n<React.Fragment>\n    <MaterialDesignDescription\n        title={'Design Localization and the New Web'}\n        description={'An examination of localization in web design by Bitmatica Lab.'}\n        url={`https://medium.com/bitmatica-lab/design-localization-and-the-new-web-f54f43c5f040`}\n        avatar={<LinkIcon style={{ width: 48, height: 48 }} />}\n    />\n    <MaterialDesignDescription\n        title={'Localization'}\n        url={`https://developer.apple.com/localization/`}\n        description={`Apple's suggestions on designing for an international market.`}\n        avatar={<LinkIcon style={{ width: 48, height: 48 }} />}\n    />\n    <MaterialDesignDescription\n        title={'Localization - Market Finder'}\n        description={'Introduction to localization by Google Market Finder.'}\n        url={`https://marketfinder.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en_us/topic/localisation/`}\n        avatar={<LinkIcon style={{ width: 48, height: 48 }} />}\n    />\n    <MaterialDesignDescription\n        title={'Internationalization and Localization'}\n        description={'A checklist from Wikipedia.'}\n        url={`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization#Scope`}\n        avatar={<LinkIcon style={{ width: 48, height: 48 }} />}\n    />\n    <Divider />\n</React.Fragment>\n\n# Developers\n\nThere are a number of available libraries to assist with implementing internationalization in your applications.\n\n## Angular and Ionic\n\nFor projects that need the ability to swap between languages, we recommend using [ngx-translate](https://github.com/ngx-translate/core). As an alternative, the Angular framework has a powerful built-in [i18n tool](https://angular.io/guide/i18n) available, but it requires a separate web app be built for each supported language (e.g. an English version, a Spanish version, etc). This is ideal for larger projects that don't require in-app language switching and don't support more than a few locales.\n\n## React\n\nThere are many JS libraries available to help internationalize your applications. We recommend using [react-i18next](https://github.com/i18next/react-i18next) to manage your translations. If you are supporting right-to-left languages, you should also carefully follow the guide from [Material-UI](https://mui.com/guides/right-to-left).\n\n## React Native\n\nAs with React for web, we recommend using [react-i18next](https://github.com/i18next/react-i18next) to manage your translations. If you are supporting right-to-left languages, you can make use of the [I18nManager](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2016/08/19/right-to-left-support-for-react-native-apps) from React Native.\n"

One of the most common such elements is a timestamp, which usually occurs in timelines or device logs. If you have a large number of items in a list with timestamps, you should group them by date to make them easier to scan.\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[NotificationBucketsImage1, NotificationBucketsImage2]}\n    caption={[\n        'When using a timestamp, list items may be grouped into logical buckets.',\n        '1: \"Today - Yesterday - Earlier This Week\" buckets',\n        '2: Raw date buckets.

In most cases, the ability to re-order the list should be locked behind an Edit Mode toggle mechanism.\n\n## Local List Item Actions\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[LocalListActionsImage, LocalListActions2Image]}\n    caption={[\n        '1: A 3-dot icon, used to open a menu for more list actions.',\n        '2: A chevron, usually indicates the entire list item is clickable and opens up a new page with list item details.',\n        '3: A few icons that serve as list action buttons.',\n        '4: An inline checkbox to toggle a status.',\n        '5: An inline text field for data entry.',\n        '6: An inline toggle switch.',\n        '7: An inline dropdown field.',\n        '8: An inline radio button group.',\n    ]}\n/>\n\nIf there are actions that you need to perform on individual list items, you may add icon buttons or an action menu. If you have three or fewer actions, they can be represented by individual icon buttons. If there are more than three, you should move them into an action menu.\n\n> If your entire list item is clickable, you should not include local list actions, as the two interactions can interfere with one another.\n\nOn desktop applications, you may use hover events to display applicable list actions. Hover list actions can save space, leaving more room for displaying static information.\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[HoverActionsImage]}\n    caption={\n        'Hover actions can save room on desktop applications and allow you to avoid repeated columns of action buttons, but the nature of hover prevents this pattern from being used on touch screen devices.'\n    }\n    regularWidth\n/>\n\n### Navigating Down a Tree Structure\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[NavigateListImage1, NavigateListImage2]}\n    caption={['1: A list used for separated pages.', '2: A list displaying a folder structure.']}\n/>\n\nLists can be used to navigate a tree-like structure in an application. See [the navigation pattern](/patterns/navigation).\n\n### Actions on Selected Items\n\n<React.Fragment>\n    <ImageGrid images={[MultiSelectImage]} regularWidth />\n    <DemoCard\n        repository={'multiselect-list'}\n        angular={`https://stackblitz.com/github/brightlayer-ui/angular-design-patterns/tree/master?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpages%2Flist%2Fmultiselect-list%2Fmultiselect-list.component.ts`}\n        react={`https://codesandbox.io/s/github/brightlayer-ui/react-design-patterns/tree/master?file=/src/pages/lists/multiselect-list/index.tsx&initialpath=multiselect-list`}\n        ionic={`https://stackblitz.com/github/brightlayer-ui/ionic-design-patterns?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpages%2Flist%2Fmultiselect-list%2Fmultiselect-list.component.ts`}\n        reactNative\n    />\n</React.Fragment>\n\nYou may want to take action on several list items at once, but not all. The easiest way to do this is through a multi-select list. You may optionally add a highlight color for the selected items.\n\n## Responsive Design\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[\n        NotificationListDesktopImage,\n        NotificationListMobileImage,\n        DashboardListDesktopImage,\n        DashboardListMobileImage,\n    ]}\n    caption={'List items should be designed to work on both desktop (1 & 3) and mobile (2 & 4).'}\n/>\n\nWhen it comes to responsive design and progressive disclosure, it can be tricky to fit all the information from a list onto a smaller screen. Here are some best practices on designing for mobile:\n\n-   Avoid using tables if possible, or reduce the number of columns visible on mobile.\n-   Remove less critical information from lists on mobile.\n-   Use summary cards with a \"view more\" option to view the full data.\n-   Use gestures (e.g., long-press, swipe-left) that align with the target device's native behavior.\n\n<Divider />\n\n# Design Specifications\n\n<React.Fragment>\n    <ImageGrid\n        images={[Spec1Image, Spec2Image, Spec3Image, Spec4Image, Spec5Image, SpecTypographyImage]}\n        regularWidth\n    />\n    <MaterialDesignDescription\n        title={'Lists'}\n        description={`For additional instructions, refer to Material Design's design specs`}\n        url={`https://material.io/components/lists#specs`}\n    />\n    <MaterialDesignDescription\n        title={'Data Tables'}\n        description={`For additional instructions, refer to Material Design's design specs`}\n        url={`https://material.io/components/data-tables#specs`}\n    />\n    <Divider />\n</React.Fragment>\n\n# Developers\n\nUse the following components to implement this pattern:\n\n**Angular** and **Ionic**:\n\n-   Angular Material\n    -   [List](https://material.angular.io/components/list/overview)\n    -   [Table](https://material.angular.io/components/table/overview)\n-   @brightlayer-ui/angular-components\n    -   [Info List Item](https://brightlayer-ui-components.github.io/angular/?path=/info/components-info-list-item--readme)\n    -   [List Item Tag](https://brightlayer-ui-components.github.io/angular/?path=/info/components-list-item-tag--readme)\n\n> In Angular, the CDK (Component Developer's Kit) version 7+ is required to use the drag-and-drop feature.\n\n**React**:\n\n-   Material UI\n    -   [List](https://mui.com/api/list/)\n    -   [List Item](https://mui.com/api/list-item/)\n-   @brightlayer-ui/angular-components\n    -   [Info List Item](https://brightlayer-ui-components.github.io/react/?path=/info/components-info-list-item--get-read-me-story)\n    -   [List Item Tag](https://brightlayer-ui-components.github.io/react/?path=/info/components-list-item-tag--get-read-me-story)\n\n**React Native**:\n\n-   React-Native\n    -   [Flat List](https://reactnative.dev/docs/using-a-listview)\n-   React Native Paper\n    -   [List Item](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/list-item.html)\n-   @brightlayer-ui/react-native-components\n    -   [Info List Item](https://brightlayer-ui-components.github.io/react-native/?path=/info/components-documentation--info-list-item)\n    -   [List Item Tag](https://brightlayer-ui-components.github.io/react-native/?path=/info/components-documentation--list-item-tag)\n"

When this happens, you will need to provide some indication to the user that something is happening. Different situations may call for different styles of indicator, explained below.\n\n<React.Fragment>\n    <MaterialDesignDescription\n        title={'Progress Indicators'}\n        url={`https://material.io/components/progress-indicators`}\n    />\n    <TOC\n        anchors={[\n            { title: 'Introduction', hash: '#loading--waiting' },\n            { title: 'Variations', hash: '#variations' },\n            { title: 'Behaviors', hash: '#behaviors' },\n            { title: 'Design Specifications', hash: '#design-specifications' },\n            { title: 'Developers', hash: '#developers' },\n        ]}\n    />\n    <Divider />\n</React.Fragment>\n\n# Variations\n\nThere are a number of different ways to indicate to a user that something is happening / loading behind the scenes. Different variations are appropriate in different situations.\n\n## Placeholder Shapes / Skeleton\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[Skeleton]}\n    caption={['When your application is loading structured data, use skeletons to tell your user what to expect.']}\n    regularWidth\n/>\n\nWhen loading data for the first time, you do not want to show an empty screen while you are fetching the data. Instead, you should show placeholder shapes (\"skeletons\") that mimic the data that will eventually be loaded. This will give the impression that your application is faster and gives users an indication of what kind of data is being loaded.\n\n<DemoCard\n    repository={'Skeletons'}\n    angular={`https://stackblitz.com/github/brightlayer-ui/angular-design-patterns/tree/master?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpages%2Floading-waiting-states%2Fskeleton-loader%2Fskeleton-loader.component.html`}\n    react={`https://codesandbox.io/s/github/brightlayer-ui/react-design-patterns/tree/master?file=/src/pages/loading-waiting-states/skeletons/Skeletons.tsx&initialpath=skeletons`}\n    reactNative\n/>\n\nThe skeleton should match as closely as possible the real _structure_ of the data, using shapes like rectangles and circles. The data _length_, however, may not be available at the time of loading, and it is likely that your skeleton ended up looking slightly different from your real data. This is OK; your mission is only to set up users' expectations.\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[Wave, Pulsate]}\n    caption={[\n        'Skeletons are usually animated, to indicate that the application is still running and responding. There are two kinds of skeleton animations.',\n        '1: Wave, where a gradient is animated from side to side over gray shapes.',\n        '2: Pulsate, where the brightness of the gray shapes is animated periodically.',\n    ]}\n/>\n\n## Spinner Overlays\n\nSpinner overlays make use of a semi-transparent overlay with a large, centered spinner. This variation of indicators is useful when you want to block user interaction with the screen (or a section of the screen) while processing occurs.\n\n<ImageGrid\n    regularWidth\n    images={[OverlaySpinner]}\n    caption={['1: Use of overlay spinner when loading EULA.', '2. Remove the overlay once the data is loaded.']}\n/>\n\n<DemoCard\n    repository={'Spinner Overlays'}\n    angular={`https://stackblitz.com/github/brightlayer-ui/angular-design-patterns/tree/master?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpages%2Floading-waiting-states%2Fspinner-overlays%2Fspinner-overlays.component.html`}\n    react={`https://codesandbox.io/s/github/brightlayer-ui/react-design-patterns/tree/master?file=/src/pages/loading-waiting-states/spinner-overlays/index.tsx&initialpath=spinner-overlays`}\n    reactNative\n/>\n\n## Contextual Spinners\n\nContextual spinners can be used as an alternative to spinner overlays in certain situations. The most common application of contextual spinners is during [Form](/patterns/forms) submission / verification. If you need to wait for a server response to validate inputs in a form (after clicking the submit button), you should disable the submit button and replace its label with a spinner. If the verification succeeds, the application should proceed to the next screen. If verification fails, the appropriate error messages should be displayed and the submit button label restored.\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[InlineSpinner]}\n    regularWidth\n    caption={[\n        'After the user clicks the submit button, the app waits for the server response, and displays an error message.',\n    ]}\n/>\n\n<DemoCard\n    repository={'Contextual Spinner'}\n    angular={`https://stackblitz.com/github/brightlayer-ui/angular-design-patterns/tree/master?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpages%2Floading-waiting-states%2Fcontextual-spinners%2Fcontextual-spinners.component.html`}\n    react={`https://codesandbox.io/s/github/brightlayer-ui/react-design-patterns/tree/master?file=/src/pages/loading-waiting-states/contextual-spinner/ContextualSpinner.tsx&initialpath=contextual-spinner`}\n    reactNative\n/>\n\n## Progress Bars\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[ProgressBar]}\n    caption={'Use progress bar when the progress is measurable, such as when the user is uploading a known-sized file.'}\n/>\n\nProgress bars should be used sparingly in your application. They should only be used in situations where progress is discrete / measurable. For example, it could be used to indicate progress when uploading a file to a server.\n\n<DemoCard\n    repository={'Progress Bar'}\n    angular={`https://stackblitz.com/github/brightlayer-ui/angular-design-patterns/tree/master?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpages%2Floading-waiting-states%2Fprogress-bars%2Fprogress-bars.component.html`}\n    react={`https://codesandbox.io/s/github/brightlayer-ui/react-design-patterns/tree/master?file=/src/pages/loading-waiting-states/progress-bar/index.tsx&initialpath=progress-bar`}\n    reactNative\n/>\n\n<DemoCard\n    repository={'Indeterminate Progress Bar'}\n    angular={`https://stackblitz.com/github/brightlayer-ui/angular-design-patterns/tree/master?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpages%2Floading-waiting-states%2Fprogress-bar-indeterminate%2Fprogress-bar-indeterminate.component.html`}\n    react={`https://codesandbox.io/s/github/brightlayer-ui/react-design-patterns/tree/master?file=/src/pages/loading-waiting-states/progress-bar-indeterminate/index.tsx&initialpath=progress-bar-indeterminate`}\n    reactNative\n/>\n\n<Divider />\n\n# Behaviors\n\n## Real-time Data (Polling / Pub-Sub)\n\nIf you are showing real-time data (either via polling or a push mechanism from the server), there is no need to show loading indicators. If you wish, you can display a small indicator when data is being refreshed or mention somewhere on the screen when the data was last refreshed so users can identify if the data is stale. You should avoid showing a loading indicator if your data is refreshed more than once per minute.\n\n<ImageGrid\n    regularWidth\n    images={[MiniSpinner]}\n    caption={'You can place a small loading icon in the header when data is updating.'}\n/>\n\n## Manual Refresh\n\nIf your users can manually refresh data on the screen, you may wish to show the placeholder elements (as with initial load), or simply refresh the data behind the scenes without indication (as with real-time). Ultimately, this should depend on how long it takes to refresh the data - if it takes more than one second to load the data, you should use an indicator.\n\n<Divider />\n\n# Design Specifications\n\nContext plays an important role in sizing your indicators. If you are using them in a small container, you may need to scale down from the recommended size.\n\n<React.Fragment>\n    <ImageGrid\n        regularWidth\n        images={[Specs]}\n        caption={[\n            '1. Overlay spinners should default to size 96.',\n            '2. Contextual button spinners should use size 20.',\n        ]}\n    />\n    <Divider />\n</React.Fragment>\n\n# Developers\n\n## Placeholder Shapes / Skeleton\n\nThere are a number of libraries available to help you create placeholder shapes, such as:\n\n**Angular**:\n\n-   [@netbasal/ngx-content-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@netbasal/ngx-content-loader)\n-   [placeholder-loading](https://www.npmjs.com/package/placeholder-loading)\n\n**Ionic**:\n\n-   [@netbasal/ngx-content-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@netbasal/ngx-content-loader)\n-   [placeholder-loading](https://www.npmjs.com/package/placeholder-loading)\n-   [ion-skeleton-text](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/skeleton-text)\n\n**React**:\n\n-   [placeholder-loading](https://www.npmjs.com/package/placeholder-loading)\n-   [react-content-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-content-loader)\n-   [@material-ui/lab/Skeleton](https://mui.com/components/skeleton/#skeleton)\n\n**React Native**:\n\n-   [rn-placeholder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rn-placeholder)\n\n## Progress Indicators\n\nAdditionally, you should use the following progress / spinner components:\n\n**Angular** and **Ionic** - Angular Material:\n\n-   [Progress Spinner](https://material.angular.io/components/progress-spinner/overview)\n-   [Progress Bar](https://material.angular.io/components/progress-bar/overview)\n\n**React** - Material UI:\n\n-   [Circular Progress](https://mui.com/components/progress/#circular)\n-   [Linear Progress](https://mui.com/components/progress/#linear)\n\n**React Native** - React Native Paper:\n\n-   [Activity Indicator](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/activity-indicator.html)\n-   [Progress Bar](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/progress-bar.html)\n"

Use this variation if you have:\n\n-   a mobile application\n-   extreme space limitations\n\n<React.Fragment>\n    <ImageGrid images={[NavigationTemporaryImg]} caption={'Opened temporary drawer with overlay.'} regularWidth />\n    <Divider />\n</React.Fragment>\n\n# Tab Navigation\n\nTab navigation uses a horizontal bar with buttons for each navigation location. These can appear at the top or bottom of your application.\n\n## Tabs on the Top\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[NavigationTabsImg]}\n    caption={['A rail menu (#1) combined with a tab navigation (#2) to show sub-pages within the settings page.']}\n    regularWidth\n/>\n<MaterialDesignDescription title={'Tabs'} url={`https://material.io/components/tabs`} />\n\nYou can combine tabs and a drawer as a way to navigate between sub-pages (e.g., you may have several sub-pages on your main settings page). In this case, the tabs usually sit on a secondary [app bar](/patterns/appbar).\n\n## Tabs on the Bottom\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[NavigationBottomImg]}\n    caption={[\n        'Bottom tabs can be a good substitute for drawers when you have less than six primary navigation routes.',\n    ]}\n    regularWidth\n/>\n<MaterialDesignDescription title={'Bottom Navigation'} url={`https://material.io/components/bottom-navigation`} />\n\nFor mobile and tablet applications, you may use bottom tabs to replace the classic drawer. Bottom tabs are a quick and easy way to navigate to the most frequently used primary navigation routes.\n\nBottom tabs can also be used in combination with a drawer. The tabs are more prominent and can be used to highlight some main routes and features, while the drawer handles the less important routes like settings, legal documents, FAQ pages.\n\n<React.Fragment>\n    <ImageGrid\n        images={[NavigationBottomWithDrawerImg]}\n        caption={[\n            '1. Menu button activates a temporary content-cover menu',\n            '2. Bottom tab navigation makes the primary pages more prominent.',\n        ]}\n        regularWidth\n    />\n    <Divider />\n</React.Fragment>\n\n# Behaviors\n\n## Nested Navigation\n\nWhen using drawer navigation, you can have multiple levels of the navigation hierarchy. These appear as expandable panels in the drawer. When using hierarchical navigation in the drawer, you should try to limit yourself to no more than two levels.\n\n<ImageGrid images={[NestedItemImg]} caption={'Open and closed nested navigation.'} regularWidth />\n\n## Content-Cover vs. Content-Resize\n\nWhen a drawer is opened, there are two ways to deal with the main application content.\n\nWith content-resize, the main application content resizes its area to accommodate the expanded drawer. This is the default behavior for most drawer variations.\n\nWith content-cover, the navigation panel appears on top of the main application content, partially obscuring it. This typically uses a dark overlay behind the drawer to direct the user's focus to the navigation panel and block interaction with the main content. This pattern is most common when using the temporary drawer variant on mobile and tablet applications.\n\n<React.Fragment>\n    <ImageGrid\n        images={[ContentCoverImg]}\n        caption={[\n            '1. Displays the normal collapsed state of the menu.',\n            '2.

Displays the open state of the menu with content pushed to the right.',\n        ]}\n        regularWidth\n    />\n</React.Fragment>\n\n## Dividers\n\nDivider lines can be used between navigation items in the drawer. They are most effective when used for:\n\n-   separating nested drawer items\n-   separating sections of the drawer contents\n\n<React.Fragment>\n    <ImageGrid\n        images={[DividerGroupImage]}\n        regularWidth\n        caption={['Dividers can be used to separate different sections of the drawer contents.']}\n    />\n    <ImageGrid\n        images={[DividerImage]}\n        regularWidth\n        caption={[\n            '1.

They can be used to supplement the information found in your primary content or to capture input from a user. For example, they can be used to present a confirmation dialog, details about a selected item, or actions that can be taken on a page.\n\nThe most common overlays in Brightlayer UI applications are:\n\n-   Confirmation dialogs\n-   Information sidebars\n-   Navigation menus\n-   Add / Edit dialogs\n\n<Divider />\n\n# Variations\n\nOverlay elements come in a variety of shapes and sizes depending on their purpose and can be either blocking (i.e., the user must interact with the overlay before they can do anything else) or non-blocking.\n\n## Modal Dialog\n\n<React.Fragment>\n    <ImageGrid\n        regularWidth\n        images={[SimpleDialog]}\n        caption={'A typical use case for a modal dialog — session expiration warning.'}\n    />\n    <MaterialDesignDescription title={'Dialogs'} url={`https://material.io/components/dialogs/`} />\n</React.Fragment>\n\nThe modal dialog appears in the center of the screen in front of the primary content. They present critical information to users or ask them to make a decision, such as confirming the deletion of an item.\n\nSimple modals should have a title, a descriptive message, and action buttons for users to respond to the prompt or dismiss the dialog. These modals should be no larger than is necessary to contain their contents.\n\nModals are also great for presenting single-screen tasks to user, such as changing a password.\n\n<React.Fragment>\n    <ImageGrid\n        regularWidth\n        images={[DialogTask]}\n        caption={[\n            'A modal dialog can present a single-screen workflow, such as changing a password.',\n            '1.

Most commonly, they display information about a selected item in the main interface (e.g., selecting an item in a list would open a sidebar on the right with additional details about the selected item). However, they can also be used as permanent UI elements, such as the legend for a chart or map.\n\n<ImageGrid regularWidth images={[TrendLegend]} caption={'A permanent sidebar can be used for chart / map legends.'} />\n\nThey can also present simple form data and inputs, such as radio buttons, checkbox, dropdown menus, etc. for editing a selected item. This type of sidebar should be dismissible, such that the user can easily close it with a close button or clicking elsewhere on the screen.\n\nSidebars should always appear on the opposite side of the screen as the main [navigation](/patterns/navigation).\n\n> In general, modals should be used when creating new data, and sidebars should be used for viewing and editing existing data.\n\n## Bottom Sheet\n\n<MaterialDesignDescription title={'Sheets: Bottom'} url={`https://material.io/components/sheets-bottom/`} />\n\nBottom sheets are content surfaces that slide in from the bottom of the screen, primarily used in mobile applications. These typically contain a list of options or actions and are usually activated via an action button in the [app bar](/patterns/appbar).\n\nThere are three types of bottom sheet: **Standard**, **Modal**, and **Expandable**.\n\n<React.Fragment>\n    <ImageGrid\n        regularWidth\n        images={[Maps]}\n        caption={[\n            '1.

workflows should follow the rules specified by our [forms and validation](/patterns/forms) pattern, and multi-step workflows should be connected using our [steppers](/patterns/steppers) pattern.\n\n<MaterialDesignDescription\n    title={'Forms and Validation'}\n    url={'/patterns/forms'}\n    description={`Follow Brightlayer UI's guideline for form controls.`}\n    avatar={<PxblueSmallAltIcon style={{ width: 48, height: 48 }} />}\n/>\n<MaterialDesignDescription\n    title={'Steppers'}\n    url={'/patterns/steppers'}\n    description={`Follow Brightlayer UI's guideline for navigating between pages.`}\n    avatar={<PxblueSmallAltIcon style={{ width: 48, height: 48 }} />}\n/>\n\nYour authentication and registration workflows should work equally well on different screen sizes. On mobile, these should be presented as full-screen layouts, whereas on desktop, they should be presented in a card centered on the screen as an [overlay](/patterns/overlay).\n\n## Registration\n\nRegistration is the process of user account creation. Typically, users can either register themselves (self-registration) or you can invite them to join your application (invitation-based).\n\n**Self-Registration**\n\nIf you do not need to restrict who can register for your application, you can allow users to self-register. The self-registration workflow includes the following steps:\n\n-   Enter email address\n-   Accept EULA\n-   Receive an email for verification\n-   Verify email\n-   Create password\n-   Add account details\n-   Success: account created\n\n**Registration via Invitation**\n\nIf you need to restrict who is able to use your application, you may choose to go with a invitation-based registration. In this situation, a system admin sends an email to authorized users inviting them to register. The invitation-based registration workflow includes the following steps:\n\n-   Receive an email for invitation\n-   Accept EULA\n-   Create password\n-   Add account details\n-   Success: account created\n\n### Screens\n\nThe majority of the registration screens are the same between invitation-based and self-registration. The primary difference is in how the registration workflow is initiated, and whether the email needs to be verified. Use the following screens for the registration workflow where appropriate.\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[EnterEmailAdress, AcceptEULA, VerifyEmail, CreatePassword, AccountDetails, WelcomeOnboard]}\n    caption={[\n        'Screens in the registration workflow.',\n        '1: Enter email address',\n        '2: Accept EULA',\n        '3: Verify email',\n        '4: Create password',\n        '5: Add account details',\n        '6: Success: account created',\n    ]}\n/>\n\n> The purpose of a success screen is to assure the user that something has been achieved. These screens can be an opportunity to perform more product branding — you are encouraged to use animations and [graphics](/style/illustrations) on these screens.\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[RegistrationDesktop]}\n    caption={'A registration screen example on desktop.'}\n    regularWidth\n    style={{ marginTop: '2em' }}\n/>\n\n## Joining an Organization\n\nSome applications may require users to join specific groups or organizations after creating an account. Generally, there are three ways for a user to join an organization:\n\n**Request Access**\n\nThis occurs when a user has an account but need to access an invitation-only organization. This workflow involves the following steps:\n\n-   Enter organization identifier\n-   Success: request sent\n-   Receive an email invitation\n-   Success: organization joined\n\n**Join with Invitation**\n\nJoining via invitation occurs when a system admin extends an invitation for a user to join a group. If the user does not yet have an account, they will first proceed through the invitation-based registration workflow followed by the screens for joining the organization. This workflow includes the following steps:\n\n-   Receive an email invitation\n-   Success: organization joined\n\n### Screens\n\nThe majority of the joining-an-organization screens are the same regardless of the underlying mechanism. Use the following screens for the joining-an-organization workflow where appropriate.\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[EnterOrganizationCode, EnterOrganizationConfirm, EnterOrganizationWelcome]}\n    caption={[\n        'Screens in the joining-an-organization workflow.',\n        '1: Enter organization identifier',\n        '2: Success: request sent',\n        '3: Success: organization joined',\n    ]}\n/>\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[JoinAnOrganizationDesktop]}\n    caption={'A join-an-organization screen example on desktop.'}\n    regularWidth\n/>\n\n## Login\n\n<!--\nAn NFC login might either be documented here, or wait until we start adding in device registery / discovery pattern\n-->\n\nLogging in can usually be accomplished in one of two ways: basic login or login via a third-party.\n\n**Basic Login**\n\nA simple login presents fields for the users to enter their credentials and a button to submit them for verification.\n\nThe login screen should always present information on how to create an account and what to do if a user has forgotten their credentials — these buttons should trigger the Registration and Forgot Password (see below) workflows .\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[Login]}\n    caption={[\n        'A standard login screen.',\n        '1: Product identifications, such as product name or logo.',\n        '2: You may also add a subtle background image with gradient to enhance the visual design and express the product brand.',\n        '3: \"Remember me\" and \"password visibility\" are two features that improve user experience, but introduce potential security concerns.',\n        '4: Login screens often include extra functions, such as \"forgot password\", \"sign up\", and \"contact your organization admin\".',\n        '5: You may add certification badges and logos from partnerships here.',\n    ]}\n    gridImageProps={{ sm: 8 }}\n/>\n<ImageGrid images={[LoginDesktop]} caption={'A login screen example on desktop.'} regularWidth />\n\n**Login via Third Party**\n\nSome applications, especially consumer-facing ones, can be authorized via third-party accounts / credentials. Different platforms may have different requirements for this. Here are some commonly used platforms and their instructions:\n\n-   [Login with Amazon](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/login-with-amazon/brand.html)\n-   [Google Sign-in](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in)\n-   [Sign in with Apple](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sign-in-with-apple/overview/introduction/)\n-   [Facebook Login](http://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/)\n-   [Sign in with Microsoft](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/identity/add-sign-in-with-microsoft)\n\n## Forgot / Change Password\n\n**Forgot password**\n\nThe login screen for an application should also present users with a way to reset their password if they have forgotten it. This is typically displayed as a hyperlink below the credential fields. Clicking the link will present users with a field to enter their e-mail address. They will then receive an email with a hyperlink to reset their password. This workflow involves the following steps:\n\n-   Enter email address\n-   Success: reset instructions sent\n-   Receive an email for resetting the password\n-   Create a new password\n-   Success: password updated\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[ForgotPasswordEnterEmail, ForgotPasswordConfirmSent, ForgotPasswordNewPassword, ForgotPasswordWelcome]}\n    caption={[\n        '1: Enter email address',\n        '2: Success: reset instructions sent',\n        '3: Create a new assword',\n        '4: Success: password reset',\n    ]}\n/>\n<ImageGrid images={[ResetPasswordDesktop]} caption={'A reset-password screen example on desktop.'} regularWidth />\n\n**Change Password**\n\nWhen the users are logged in, they have the option to change their password by going through the change password workflow, typically triggered from within the user settings. This workflow includes the following steps:\n\n-   Change password\n-   Success: password updated\n\n> After a successful password change, users should be logged out and forced to log in with the new credentials.\n\n<React.Fragment>\n    <ImageGrid\n        images={[ChangePassword, ChangePasswordWelcome]}\n        caption={['1: Change password', '2: Success: password changed']}\n    />\n    <ImageGrid images={[ChangePasswordDesktop]} caption={'A change-password screen example on desktop.'} regularWidth />\n    <Divider />\n</React.Fragment>\n\n# Behaviors\n\n## Email Communications\n\n<!-- This might deserve its own pattern. We already have something in the backlog to design for an email template. -->\n\nEmail communications are frequently used throughout the user authentication workflow to verify the user's identity. Users receive emails for invitations, address verification, confirmation codes, etc.\n\nEmails are also sent to confirm security-related changes to a user's account, such as changing a password, updating a profile, etc. You should never allow users to unsubscribe from security-related email notifications.\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[EmailCommunicationInvitation, EmailCommunicationVerification]}\n    caption={['Two examples of email communications', '1: Invitation to join', '2: Verifying email address']}\n/>\n\n## Terminated Workflows & Expired Sessions\n\nDuring the registration, if a user leaves the application before creating a password for their account, the whole session is treated as expired, and upon returning, they must start the registration process over again.\n\nIf an invitation link or verification code has expired, the users should be able to request for another invitation link or verification code.\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[ExpiredCode]}\n    caption={'Users should have a way to re-initiate an expired email verification.'}\n    regularWidth\n/>\n\n## Security Concerns\n\n### Error Messages\n\nWhen a user encounters an error — such as a password mismatch or the server is temporarily down — they should be notified with an appropriate error message. However, be very careful when presenting error messages to the users. You should only show what is necessary to recover from the problem, such as \"incorrect email or password\" or \"server unavailable\" — do not expose information that could compromise the security of your application.\n\n> Do **NOT** provide messages like \"User does not exist,\" \"Incorrect Password,\" etc.\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[ErrorStates]}\n    caption={\n        'For security, you should not present more information than is necessary. For invalid credentials, you should highlight both fields and say \"Invalid Credentials.\"'\n    }\n    regularWidth\n/>\n\n### Exposing Credentials\n\nUnlike a phone application, a shared HMI application is more vulnerable to outside threats via showing credentials. These projects should **NOT** implement password visibility toggles or \"remember me\" functionality.\n\n### Two-Factor Authentication\n\nThe examples on this page used email as the login credentials. However, if your project requires additional security, consider using two-factor authentication. Two-factor authentication involves sending an additional confirmation code (typically via email or SMS) to verify a user's identity after they enter their password.\n\n<Divider />\n\n# Developers\n\nWe recommend using the following packages to construct these workflows.

You should adhere to Brightlayer UI's color theme unless you are creating your own components.`}\n/>\n\nOur color sets are divided into sections as outlined below. User Interface and Status colors are available in a single package ([@brightlayer-ui/colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/colors)). Branding (Charts and Graphs) colors are available as an additional package ([@brightlayer-ui/colors-branding](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/colors-branding)).\n\nIn most cases, you should stick to using the 500 color (<Bookmark style={{ verticalAlign: 'middle' }} />), which is the primary color for each palette. When using Brightlayer UI themes, the most important elements of the UI will be stylized with these colors.\n\n<Divider />\n\n# User Interface Colors\n\nUser Interface colors are designed to be the main colors used in the application. Use them in elements such as app bars, toolbars, page backgrounds, buttons, text, etc. These colors may also be used in branding or marketing of products and services.\n\n### Blue\n\n<ColorPalette palette={Colors.blue} />\n\n### White\n\n<ColorPalette palette={Colors.white} />\n\n### Gray\n\n<ColorPalette palette={Colors.gray} />\n\n### Black\n\nAvoid the use of pure black (**#000000**) in a UI, except in instances where you have a Dark Mode display on an OLED screen.\n\n<ColorPalette palette={Colors.black} />\n\n### Dark Black\n\nThese colors are only for [dark themes](/style/themes#dark-theme--blue-dark-theme).\n\n<ColorPalette palette={Colors.darkBlack} />\n<Divider />\n\n# Status Colors\n\nStatus colors have a special meaning in the context of Brightlayer UI applications. They are used to communicate information such as Alarms, Warnings, Successes, Running or Energized status, etc. These colors should **_never_** be used purely as marketing colors and **_never_** used without a clear purpose. Status colors should be used to reinforce a status or state throughout an interface. For example, an alarm row in a list may use a red colored bell icon, paired with red text and a red border stripe. When navigating to details for that alarm, the app bar may be colored red. This will solidify the association that red = alarm = bell and make it easier for a user to find alarms at a glance in an application.\n\n### Red\n\nRed is used to denote Alarms and Errors. Avoid using it for any other purpose.\n\n<ColorPalette palette={Colors.red} />\n\n### Orange\n\nOrange is used to denote warnings, loss of communication, and other types of alerts. Avoid using it for any states that do not require attention.\n\n<ColorPalette palette={Colors.orange} />\n\n### Gold\n\nGold can be used to give additional variety to your alerts in combination with Red and Orange.\n\n<ColorPalette palette={Colors.gold} />\n\n### Yellow\n\nYellow can be used to indicate tripped status for electrical devices, or low-level alerts.\n\n<ColorPalette palette={Colors.yellow} />\n\n### Green\n\nGreen can be used to indicate \"safety\", \"good\", \"success\", or other positive states.\n\n<ColorPalette palette={Colors.green} />\n\n### Light Blue\n\nLight Blue should not be confused with the UI Blue. This can be used to indicate a variety of statuses, including Maintenance Mode, device disabled, etc.\n\n<ColorPalette palette={Colors.lightBlue} />\n\n### Purple\n\nPurple is used to denote a device is disarmed. Avoid using it for any states that do not require attention.\n\n<ColorPalette palette={Colors.purple} />\n<Divider />\n\n# Branding Colors\n\nThis expanded version of the color palette contains colors to be used for marketing, product identity, [data visualization](/patterns/visualizations) (non-status), etc. Brightlayer UI uses these colors as the palette for charting and graphing.\n\n### Blue\n\n<ColorPalette palette={BrandingColors.blue} />\n\n### Teal\n\n<ColorPalette palette={BrandingColors.teal} />\n\n### Citron\n\n<ColorPalette palette={BrandingColors.citron} />\n\n### Pine\n\n<ColorPalette palette={BrandingColors.pine} />\n\n### Emerald\n\n<ColorPalette palette={BrandingColors.emerald} />\n\n### Wine\n\n<ColorPalette palette={BrandingColors.wine} />\n\n### Crimson\n\n<ColorPalette palette={BrandingColors.crimson} />\n\n### Sunset\n\n<ColorPalette palette={BrandingColors.sunset} />\n\n### Rust\n\n<ColorPalette palette={BrandingColors.rust} />\n\n### Navy\n\n<ColorPalette palette={BrandingColors.navy} />\n\n### Sky\n\n<ColorPalette palette={BrandingColors.sky} />\n\n### Sage\n\n<ColorPalette palette={BrandingColors.sage} />\n\n### Toad\n\n<ColorPalette palette={BrandingColors.toad} />\n\n### Butter\n\n<ColorPalette palette={BrandingColors.butter} />\n\n### Goldenrod\n\n<ColorPalette palette={BrandingColors.goldenrod} />\n\n### Trophy\n\n<ColorPalette palette={BrandingColors.trophy} />\n"

We recommend finalizing your illustrations with [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html), as it provides more export options than other tools.\n\n<React.Fragment>\n    <MaterialDesignDescription\n        title={'Onboarding'}\n        url={'https://material.io/design/communication/onboarding.html'}\n        description={`Material Design's guidelines on onboarding screens.`}\n    />\n    <MaterialDesignDescription\n        title={'Google Fiber Brand Illustration Guidelines'}\n        url={`https://fiber-brand.appspot.com/illustration`}\n        description={`You are encouraged to follow their illustration guidelines.`}\n        avatar={<PDFIcon style={{ width: 40, height: 40 }} />}\n    />\n</React.Fragment>\n\n## Designing the Illustration\n\n### Perspective\n\nYour illustration should be either facing the subject matter parallel to the ground (not viewing it from above or below) or in parallel projection.\n\n### Ratio\n\nThe aspect ratio of your illustrations should be between 1:1 and 2:3 to avoid filling the full screen on mobile devices (leave room for buttons, steppers, etc.). If you are designing exclusively for desktop applications (i.e., the illustration will never show up on mobile), you can go wider, but no more than 16:9.\n\n### Drawing Style\n\nKeep your style consistent within the application. This style should also extend to any marketing sites for the product for consistency. Do not be too abstract or artistic — your main goal is to inform your users of the features in your product, not to decorate it.\n\n### Text\n\nAvoid the use of text wherever possible. It can be hard to see on mobile and will be ineffective if your application needs to support multiple languages. If you have to use text, use Open Sans as the font and ensure that words are legible on your smallest targeted device.\n\n### Color\n\nUse the [Brightlayer UI color palette](/style/color) for your [local colors](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_color_(visual_art)>). You should use some shade of blue in the foreground of your images (these can be colors from the Blue, Light Blue, or Branding Blue palettes).\n\nAvoid using colors that may blend into the application background (add a background color to to your images to help them stand out). Avoid using the 500 colors from the color palette, as they may blend in among other UI elements (buttons, etc.).\n\nAvoid using too many strokes, especially light strokes on dark backgrounds or vice-versa. Your illustrations may be reused as infographics, and line strokes could interfere with labels.\n\nTest your illustrations on both light (white 50) and dark (black 900) application backgrounds. If your application will support multiple themes, we recommended having a version of your illustrations for each.\n\nSimulate your illustrations under different colorblind conditions. Ensure your color schemes are still intact.\n\nTo maximize accessibility, use online tools (such as [Coblis](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/)) to simulate viewing your illustrations under different colorblind conditions. Ensure that your illustrations are still visible and effective.\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[LightThemeImage, DarkThemeImage]}\n    caption={'Two versions of the same design for light theme (left) and dark theme (right).'}\n/>\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[BackgroundShapeImage]}\n    caption={'Illustration backgrounds can be either a fixed shape (left) or full-bleed (right).'}\n    regularWidth\n/>\n\n### Animation\n\n<ImageGrid images={[AnimationImage]} caption={'An animated empty state illustration.'} />\n\nAnimations can draw attention to important parts of the graphic that are not easily conveyed with a static image. When combined with instructional text, they can provide a very interactive onboarding experience. You can use tools such as [Lottie](https://lottiefiles.com/) to implement and export your animation.\n\n## Export\n\nWhen finished with your artwork, remember to outline stroke. If you are using text in your illustrations (see above), do not convert to outline or stroke any of those elements — leave them as text for future translation, if necessary.\n\nName and group your root SVG layers semantically for animating. Do not minify the SVG code, as this will eliminate the naming.\n\nExport your illustrations as SVG with at least 2 decimal precision and presentation attributes enabled. After exporting, check that your graphics look correct (for higher detail graphics, you may need a higher decimal precision to keep paths smooth).\n"

Below, we cover some of the areas where Brightlayer UI differs from Material Design.\n\n<MaterialDesignDescription\n    title={'The Type System'}\n    url={'https://material.io/design/typography/the-type-system.html'}\n    description={`Material Design's typography guidelines.`}\n/>\n\nUnlike Material Design, the primary font for Brightlayer UI is [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?selection.family=Open+Sans) (licensed under [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)). This version contains the complete 897 character set, which includes the standard ISO Latin 1, Latin CE, Greek and Cyrillic character sets. Open Sans was optimized for print, web, and mobile interfaces, and has excellent legibility characteristics in its letter forms.\n\n<TOC\n    anchors={[\n        { title: 'Introduction', hash: '#typography-guidelines' },\n        { title: 'Type Scale', hash: '#type-scale' },\n        { title: 'Principles', hash: '#principles' },\n        { title: 'Customization', hash: '#customization' },\n        { title: 'Internationalization', hash: '#internationalization' },\n    ]}\n/>\n<Divider />\n\n# Type Scale\n\nPX Blue provides a type scale that includes a range of styles to support the needs of your application. All styles and fonts are available in the design library. As Brightlayer UI continues to grow, additional font patterns will be added.\n\n<TypographyTable />\n\n# Principles\n\nYou should use font variations to establish an information hierarchy in your display that guides users' attention from the most important details to the least important. Creating this information hierarchy involves using multiple font properties, including size, weight, and / or color.\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[TextHierarchy1, TextHierarchy2, TextHierarchy3, TextHierarchy4]}\n    caption={[\n        'You can manipulate different typography properties to establish hierarchy.',\n        '1: Font size',\n        '2: Font weight',\n        '3: Font color',\n        '4: Combination',\n    ]}\n/>\n\nAs you are crafting your designs, you need to understand which content is the most important from your users' perspective and make that the easiest to find on the page.\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[CompeteAttention1, CompeteAttention2]}\n    caption={[\n        `1: Do not rely solely on font weight changes to indicate an active state. Avoid having auxiliary information (e.g., the circled numbers on the right) compete for users' attention.`,\n        `2: Use clues like background color and radio buttons to clearly communicate the state.`,\n    ]}\n/>\n\nWhen changing font colors, make sure to take into consideration the [accessibility](/design/accessibility) of your chosen colors.\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[StatusColor1, StatusColor2]}\n    caption={[\n        '1: Be careful when using status colors for a large body of text, as they have reduced legibility compared to standard text colors.',\n        '2: Shorter text, such as a list item tag, may be colored to reflect a certain status.',\n    ]}\n/>\n\n<Divider />\n\n# Customization\n\nThe standard styles above should cover most of the typography needs in your application. However, it is unrealistic to presume that these styles will cover _every_ potential use case. Slight customization of these styles — such as changing a font weight for a particular component — is acceptable and expected. In most cases, these can be treated as one-off styling tweaks, rather than an entirely new style. If you find that you are using customized styles in multiple places, [contact us](/community/contactus) so we can consider standardizing these styles or provide alternative recommendations.\n\nMost Brightlayer UI components have been designed to work well with the standard styles. Most often, you'll only need to worry about custom typography styles when you are developing your own product-specific components. Keep in mind that even if you are adjusting font styles, you should still continue to use the Open Sans font family.\n\n## Common Customizations\n\nThere are a few specific elements in Brightlayer UI applications that are often customized — to the point that they can be considered alternative standard styles.\n\n### App Bar Subtitle\n\nThe most commonly customized style in Brightlayer UI applications is the subtitle in the [App Bar](/patterns/appbar) component. This typically makes use of the Body1 style, but a variety of different styles are acceptable. One favorite is to use 18dp / Light.\n\n<React.Fragment>\n    <ImageGrid\n        images={[AppBar]}\n        regularWidth\n        caption={[\n            '1: App Bar with the standard typography styles.',\n            '2: App Bar with commonly used custom subtitle style.',\n        ]}\n    />\n</React.Fragment>\n\n### Scorecard Header\n\nThe standard Scorecard component makes use of custom styles by default: the three lines of text are H6, Body1, and 14dp / Light. You should avoid changing the style for the first line, but the second and third lines can be customized as appropriate.\n\n<React.Fragment>\n    <ImageGrid\n        images={[ScoreCard]}\n        regularWidth\n        caption={[\n            '1: Scorecard with the standard typography styles.',\n            '2: Scorecard with custom text styles on the second and third lines. These styles can be adjusted based on the displayed information.',\n        ]}\n    />\n    <Divider />\n</React.Fragment>\n\n# Internationalization\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[SimplifiedChineseImg]}\n    regularWidth\n    caption={['Use \"Noto Sans CJK SC\" font for Simplified Chinese.']}\n/>\n\nFor non-western languages, we recommend using [Noto Sans](https://www.google.com/get/noto/). You should select the appropriate font variation based on the language(s) you are designing for.\n\n<React.Fragment>\n    <MaterialDesignDescription\n        title={'Internationalization'}\n        url={'/patterns/internationalization'}\n        description={`Follow Brightlayer UI's guideline to design your UI for different languages.`}\n        avatar={<PxblueSmallAltIcon style={{ width: 48, height: 48 }} />}\n    />\n    <MaterialDesignDescription\n        title={'Language Support'}\n        url={'https://material.io/design/typography/language-support.html'}\n        description={`Material Design's guideline on typography considerations for global audiences.`}\n    />\n</React.Fragment>\n"

With a clean color vibrance and high text legibility, it is well-suited for everyday use on a computer monitor, on-site facility inspection on a tablet, or on a mobile phone screen.\n\nThe light theme uses our iconic [Blue 500](/style/color) color (`#007bc1`) throughout the application, notably in toolbars, buttons, and icons. In some places, Light Blue 500 is applied as a secondary color on interactive UI elements such as form controls. The light theme's base background color is White 200, although the surface elements are often shaded in White 50 (pure white).\n\n<ImageGrid images={[LightThemeColors]} regularWidth />\n<Divider />\n\n# Dark Theme / Blue Dark Theme\n\n<ImageGrid images={[DarkThemeExample]} regularWidth caption={'An example of an application using the dark theme.'} />\n\nThe dark theme is intended primarily for applications used in low-light conditions. As the name indicates, it utilizes mostly dark colors (grays and blacks). Other colors are typically reserved for interactive components and status displays.\n\n<ImageGrid images={[DarkThemeColors]} regularWidth />\n\nTo accommodate for [accessibility requirements](/design/accessibility), Brightlayer UI uses the 200 shade of colors when text is used on a dark background, such as in an outlined button and a text field label. For \"contained\" elements, such as in an elevated / contained button, the same style is used as in the light theme (500 shades).\n\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[OutlinedAndFlat]}\n    caption={`You may use the 200 shade of text colors on a dark background (#1) or White 50 on 500 shades (#2). However, the 200 shades should never be used as a background color (#3), as they can cause glare in a dark environment.`}\n    regularWidth\n/>\n<ImageGrid\n    images={[DarkThemeElevation]}\n    caption={[\n        'In dark theme, you can express surface elevation with:',\n        '1: A different surface color.

See [our Ionic getting started guide](/development/frameworks-mobile/ionic).\n\n## React\n\nReact themes are available from our @brightlayer-ui/react-themes package, which contains JSON objects that are consumed by the theme mechanism for Material UI components (`<ThemeProvider />`), including some specific styling rules defined in [JSS](https://mui.com/styles/advanced/#jss-plugins).\n\n-   @brightlayer-ui/react-themes: [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/react-themes), [GitHub](https://github.com/brightlayer-ui/react-themes/tree/master)\n-   [Theming Guide](https://mui.com/customization/theming/) on Material-UI\n\n## React Native\n\nReact Native themes are available from our @brightlayer-ui/react-themes package, which utilize React Native Paper's theming mechanism. This package contains two separate dark themes which must be applied to different components to achieve the correct appearance (see the package readme for details).\n\n-   @brightlayer-ui/react-native-themes: [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/react-native-themes), [GitHub](https://github.com/brightlayer-ui/react-native-themes/tree/master)\n-   [Theming Guide](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/theming.html) on React Native Paper\n\n## Color Palette\n\nAll of the [Brightlayer UI colors](/style/color) are available individually ([@brightlayer-ui/colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/colors)) for use in your application. However, in most cases, you should use values from the themes to alter styles for better future-proofing.\n"

Please check out our [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/brightlayer-ui/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before you get started.\n\nWe build our code examples using GitHub and use several online tools for sharing them. These tools allow you to import GitHub repositories and make the code runnable and editable in an online IDE.\n\n-   For Angular, React, and Ionic projects we use [Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io).\n-   For React Native we use [Snack](https://snack.expo.io/). Snack requires that your project is built using the [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/expo-cli/).\n\nIf you have not used these tools before, they're a great way to play with code and make sharing code snippets much easier.

How common is this practice? How many Eaton applications use it? How many will use it in the future? Is this a low-hanging fruit or does it require significant effort? Once we reach a conclusion, we will get in touch with you about next steps.\n\nIf we move forward with the innersourcing effort, the next step is to perform a detailed audit (both design and development where appropriate) to evaluate conformity with Brightlayer UI. We will evaluate your usage of colors, components, and layouts to ensure that the proposed idea aligns with our existing patterns and we will also evaluate the overall re-usability of what you have created. During this process, we may contact you from time to time to ask questions or discuss parts of your submission.\n\nIn most cases, submissions will require some amount of iteration or updates before they will be brought into the Brightlayer UI design system. These updates can be performed by you or the Brightlayer UI team depending on availability and timeframe. We will work with you to establish a plan for releasing the new materials and add it to one of our scheduled quarterly releases (see our [roadmap](/roadmap) for details). Depending on the nature of the materials, they will be added to our Figma library (designs), NPM packages, and/or design pattern code examples.

However, we can't always cover everything. Below are some common questions that people have asked about the platform. Please check to see if your question has been answered below before contacting us directly.\n\n## General\n\n<div>\n<FAQExpander question={`Can you provide our team with an overview of Brightlayer UI?`}>\n\nYes. If you would like to meet with our team to go over the basics (whats and whys) of Brightlayer UI and go through everything that we have to offer, please get in touch with us to set up a time.\n\n</FAQExpander>\n\n<FAQExpander question={`What is your release schedule?`}>\n\nPX Blue operates on a continuous delivery model — we release new resources as soon as they are available. Our work is planned on a quarterly basis and towards the end of each quarter we hold a release announcement event where we go over all of the updates to the platform that were made during that quarter and answer questions from the community. If you would like to attend these announcements, please contact us and we will add you to our mailing list. You can track our progress for the current quarter on our [Roadmap](/roadmap) page, which is updated every two weeks.\n\n</FAQExpander>\n</div>\n\n## Developers\n\n<div>\n<FAQExpander question={`How do I start a project?`}>\n\nIf you are starting a new project, we highly recommend using the [Brightlayer UI CLI](/development/cli) to start your project. This will automatically integrate all of the necessary Brightlayer UI resources as well as give you several templates to choose from for starting your project. If you need to integrate Brightlayer UI into an existing project, we have comprehensive Getting Started guides for [Web](/development/frameworks-web/intro) and [Mobile](/development/frameworks-mobile/intro) projects that walk you through the steps necessary to add Brightlayer UI to your project, including adding themes, components libraries, etc.\n\n</FAQExpander>\n\n<FAQExpander question={`Do you support VueJS, WPF, Flutter, or other frameworks?`}>\n\nAt this time, Brightlayer UI only supports Angular or React for web projects and Ionic (with Angular) or React Native for mobile applications. While we would love to be able to support all of the other great frameworks that are out there, the Brightlayer UI team does not currently have the resources to effectively support them all. One of the primary goals of Brightlayer UI is to maximize re-usability and code-sharing between projects / teams — supporting every possible framework goes against this principle. We've tried to support enough frameworks to give teams flexibility in their choice while also ensuring that we can continue to provide meaningful content on an ongoing basis. \n\n</FAQExpander>\n\n<FAQExpander question={`Can the Brightlayer UI team build my application?`}>\n\nThe Brightlayer UI team is not currently staffed for doing project development for product teams. We are available to support your development team with integrating and using the Brightlayer UI resources in your project, but you will need to build your own development team to create your application.\n\n</FAQExpander>\n\n<FAQExpander question={`Do you have icons for _____?`}>\n\nWith Brightlayer UI, you have access to all of the Material Design icons as well as additional icons that have been designed specifically for Brightlayer UI applications. These can all be browsed on our [Iconography](/style/iconography) page. Clicking on an icon will show information about the icon including usage instructions in our supported frameworks as well as buttons to download icons individually. If you need an icon that is not currently available, contact us and we will work with you on a solution.\n\n</FAQExpander>\n\n<FAQExpander question={`How do I build my own theme?`}>\n\nMost applications should stick to using the default Brightlayer UI themes. However, in some cases you may need to develop your own theme, such as for products that are sold under a different brand or are white-labeled for other companies. In this case, you should refer to the theming instructions for your selected framework ([Angular](https://v7.material.angular.io/guide/theming), [React](https://mui.com/customization/theming/), [React Native](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/theming.html)). You may wish to start with the default Brightlayer UI themes and extend only the pieces that need to change for your project.\n\n</FAQExpander>\n\n<FAQExpander question={`Can I use other charting solutions (e.g., D3) with Brightlayer UI?`}>\n\nCurrently, Brightlayer UI recommends using [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com) for your charting needs. If you prefer an open-source charting alternative, Brightlayer UI also offers resources for working with [ChartJS](https://www.chartjs.org/). You can read more about this on our [Visualizations](/patterns/visualizations) page. You may use other charting solutions in your application if there is a genuine business need, but keep in mind that this may compromise the consistency and reusability of your solution when compared to other projects.\n\n</FAQExpander>\n\n<FAQExpander question={`What if I need to build a desktop app?`}>\n\nIf you need to build a standalone desktop application, we recommend using a tool like [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/). This will allow you to build the application using one of Brightlayer UI's supported web technologies while still being able to package the application for installation onto a desktop.\n\n</FAQExpander>\n\n<FAQExpander question={`How can I contribute?`}>\n\nIf you are interested in contributing to Brightlayer UI, that's awesome! We welcome pull requests for features and bug fixes. We're also more than happy to have you report bugs and reach out to us with comments, suggestions, or other ideas. Please read our [Innersourcing](/community/innersourcing) guide for more details.\n\n</FAQExpander>\n</div>\n\n\n## Designers\n\n<div>\n<FAQExpander question={`Do you have any design assets for Brightlayer UI?`}>\n\nYes! We have standardized on Figma as our preferred tool for designing Brightlayer UI applications. We have a [Component Sticker Sheet](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1024360297793425107) as well as a [Design Pattern Sticker Sheet](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1023327014725714313) that give you access to a wide array of design elements that you can use to kick start your projects. \n\n</FAQExpander>\n\n<FAQExpander question={`Do you have assets for Adobe Illustrator or Sketch?`}>\n\nAt this time, we have standardized on Figma as our design tool of choice for Brightlayer UI applications and will not be maintaining resources for other tools. This is to ensure that teams are able to be working from the same set of resources to help maintain consistency and re-usability across products. If you would like to learn more about Figma or getting access for you team, please get in touch with us.\n\n</FAQExpander>\n\n<FAQExpander question={`Do you have design patterns for _____?`}>\n\nWe will be continuously updating the [Design Patterns](/patterns) section with new patterns and code samples as they are available. We will prioritize patterns and examples based on interest expressed from development teams. If there is something you want to see, please contact us.\n\nIf you have built something that you would like to share, check out our information on [innersourcing](/community/innersourcing) and [Contact Us](/community/contactus) with a demo.\n\n</FAQExpander>\n\n<FAQExpander question={`What do other Brightlayer UI projects look like?`}>\n\nIf you are interested in seeing some examples of past and present projects that have been designed using Brightlayer UI, please get in touch with us. We would be more than happy to point you to some reference materials from other projects.\n\n</FAQExpander>\n\n<FAQExpander question={`How much creative freedom do I have as a designer?`}>\n\nPX Blue is not meant to limit your creativity or make you feel like you are designing in a box. We want Brightlayer UI products to feel like they are part of the same family, but we do not want them to all feel like the same application. There are some aspects of applications that need to be the same across products to drive this consistency, but other areas are fair game for you to develop your own style. You can learn more by reading our page on [Product Identity](/design/project-identity).\n\n</FAQExpander>\n\n<FAQExpander question={`What if my development team says _____ is not possible?`}>\n\nIf you are designing your project using the Brightlayer UI assets we provide, these should be achievable without much issue on the development side. If you have specific concerns, please feel free to contact our development team and we can help your developers find a solution that will work.\n\n</FAQExpander>\n\n<FAQExpander question={`How can I contribute?`} style={{marginBottom: 64}}>\n\nIf you are interested in contributing to Brightlayer UI, that's awesome! We would love to see what you have designed. If you have components or patterns that you think would be valuable to share with the rest of the Brightlayer UI community, please get in touch with us for a discussion. You can also find more information on our [Innersourcing](/community/innersourcing#how-we-innersource-new-features) page.\n\n</FAQExpander>\n</div>\n\nDon't see what you're looking for?

The team conducted extensive interviews with designers and developers to understand what they wanted out of a design system.\n-   At the end of **2017**, the team evaluated existing open-source design systems and selected Material Design to serve as the foundation of the new Brightlayer UI.\n-   In February of **2018**, Brightlayer UI 2.0 launches with support for Angular and React.\n-   In September **2018**, Brightlayer UI goes open source and makes all of the resources and materials available to the world. We also added support for developing mobile applications in addition to web.\n-   In **2019**, Brightlayer UI ramped up development of custom component libraries to supplement the components available from Material Design.\n-   In **2020**, the team released an updated CLI for automatically starting new projects with Brightlayer UI integration and began working on new multi-screen re-usable workflows. The team also won [two awards](https://www.designinnovationglobal.com/design-thinking/articles/di-global-awards-winners): Brand transformation and Enterprise Design Transformation.\n"
